# Invocation #

Whilst a youth, emerging into manhood within a mandir's Brahmachari ashrama and attending university, I read '[The Bacchae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bacchae)' and exposure to [Dionysus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus), was a revelation. I had of course read of many of the Greek Myths long prior, but it was this dramatic work and the critical readings I read, specifically Dodds (1951), to inform my understanding and writing on the subject, was a rite-of-passage.


Please write on Dionysus and culinary and experiential ecstacy. You know how I like the linguistics. Focus on theurgy, hierophany and the Gustatory of Ecstacy.

Dionysus (Διόνυσος, *Diónysos*), also called Bacchus (Βάκχος, *Bacchos*), is the Greek god of **wine, ritual ecstasy, and the gustatory revelation of the divine**[1][4][6]. His cult is a masterclass in theurgy (θεουργία, *theourgía*, “divine working”), hierophany (ἱεροφάνεια, *hieropháneia*, “manifestation of the sacred”), and the transformative power of taste and consumption.

## **Theurgy and Hierophany: Culinary Ecstasy as Divine Encounter**

**Theurgy** in the Dionysian context is not abstract ritual, but embodied, sensory, and communal. The god’s presence is invoked not just through prayer but through **tasting, drinking, feasting, and ecstatic celebration**. The *hierophany*—the showing-forth of the god—occurs when the boundaries between mortal and divine are dissolved in the act of shared consumption.

- **Wine (οἶνος, *oinos*):**  
  The central sacrament. To drink wine is to taste Dionysus himself, as the god’s essence is believed to be present in the juice of the grape, fermented and transformed.  
  *Lay pronunciation:* EE-nos  
  *Academic pronunciation:* /ˈoi.nos/

- **Omophagia (ὠμοφαγία, *ōmophagía*):**  
  The ritual eating of raw flesh, especially in the wild rites of the Maenads (Μαινάδες, *Mainádes*), is a direct, gustatory communion with the god, believed to impart his power and ecstasy[1][3][4].

- **Thyrsus (θύρσος, *thyrsos*):**  
  A fennel staff crowned with ivy or a pinecone, wielded in ritual and often dipped in honey or wine—symbolizing the blending of vegetal, sweet, and intoxicating elements.

## **The Gustatory of Ecstasy: Ritual, Taste, and Transformation**

### **Ritual Banquet and Ecstasy**

- **Bacchanalia (Βακχανάλια):**  
  Secretive, frenzied ceremonies with music, dance, and intoxicating substances[6].  
  Participants—especially women (the Maenads)—left domestic life to gather in mountains or forests, donning animal skins, crowned with ivy, and carrying the thyrsus.  
  The rites included:
  - **Frenzied dance** (χορός, *chorós*)
  - **Music** (αὐλός, *aulós* – double pipe; τύμπανον, *týmpanon* – handheld drum)
  - **Communal feasting**—the climax of which was often the consumption of wine and, symbolically or literally, raw animal flesh (sparagmos and omophagia)[1][3][5].

### **Entheogenic and Culinary Elements**

- **Wine as Entheogen:**  
  Early Dionysian wine was often low in alcohol and mixed with herbs, honey, and sometimes psychoactive substances (e.g., poppy, μήκων, *mēkōn*)[5]. The krater (κρατήρ, *kratḗr*) was the communal mixing bowl, both a culinary and sacred vessel.

- **Mead (μέθυ, *méthy*) and Beer (ζῦθος, *zŷthos*):**  
  Older than wine, these fermented drinks were also part of Dionysian ritual, especially in Thrace and Phrygia[5].

- **Bread and Fruit:**  
  Dionysus is also patron of the orchard and the harvest. Ritual meals included figs (σῦκον, *sŷkon*), barley cakes (ἄρτος, *artos*), and honey (μέλι, *meli*), all consumed as offerings and as a way to ingest the god’s bounty.

## **Linguistic and Symbolic Notes**

- **Ecstasy (ἔκστασις, *ekstasis*):**  
  Literally “standing outside oneself,” ecstasy is the state Dionysus bestows—achieved through taste, touch, sound, and movement.  
  *Academic pronunciation:* /ˈek.sta.sis/

- **Hierophany (ἱεροφάνεια, *hieropháneia*):**  
  The moment the sacred is made manifest—when wine becomes the god, and the god becomes wine.

- **Theurgy (θεουργία, *theourgía*):**  
  Divine action accomplished through ritual, especially through the senses.

## **Dionysian Culinary Theurgy: Experiencing the God Through Taste**

To eat and drink in the Dionysian rite is to **participate in the god’s own being**. The wine is not mere symbol but the living presence of Dionysus, and the act of drinking is both a hierophany and a theurgic act—an initiation into ecstasy, transformation, and the dissolution of boundaries.

> “His wine, music, and ecstatic dance were considered to free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself.”[4]

**In Dionysian ritual, the gustatory is not just pleasure—it is revelation. To taste is to know, to know is to become, and to become is to be ecstatically, divinely alive.**

What year was the 'Irrationality and the Greeks'(?) published, famous monographic work, may have title wrong?

The monograph you’re referring to is **"The Greeks and the Irrational" by E. R. Dodds**. It was **first published in 1951** as Volume 25 of the Sather Classical Lectures series[3][6][9][10][11].
