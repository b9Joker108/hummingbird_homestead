To that upon which we subsist:  
To the [wights](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wight&oldid=1292146887) that supporteth life.

## A Hallowing & Poetic Fancy: To Mote & Morsel ##

To the Unseen Dwellers: Root and Runner,  
Soil’s Intelligence and earthen Breath —  
Mushroom and Mite, Microbe and Mineral,  
all that seethe beneath Our step.

To the Rain-shaded splay of Leaves,  
the pulse of Sap down vascular Green,  
the Fruit that’s lifted and the Seed and Nut that drops,  
the Low-born, Foraging, Sky-making Kin.

To the storied beasts: Hoof and Wing,  
to Fur, to Shell; to the silent, blinking Life  
that Grazes dusk and is gathered,  
to the Honeyed labour and the Blood unspoken.

To the ancient Pulse of Yeast and Fire,  
to the Blade, the Berry, the Leavening crust,  
to all that once drew Breath  
and all who Break and Bless.

To the Chorus of Sustenance: Wild, Exotic, Sumptuous, Humble -  
Wights in the Unseen Parliament-of-Earth:  
without Thee, Our feasts are hollow,  
Our days, unbuttered.

*This is a poetic invocation in the tradition of food poetry—echoing the mode of Pablo Neruda’s "Ode to the Onion," Robert Frost’s "Blueberries," Virgil’s "Salad," and the bread and fruit verses of classic English and American writers[5][6][7]. It draws on an animist sense of gratitude towards the vital but often-unseen presences—the “wights” or spirits—supporting the chain of nourishment that sustains mortal life.*

## Artisanal To-Do ##

### An Illumination ###

**Illuminated Script** refers to the art form of hand-lettered manuscripts—often from the medieval and early modern eras—decorated with gold or silver leaf, vibrant pigments, and intricate borders, initials, and miniature illustrations. Such works are commonly found in religious texts (like psalters, Books of Hours, and bibles), as well as in poetry and culinary manuscripts[9].

### Core Features of Illuminated Script

- **Elaborate Initials:** The first letter of a stanza or paragraph is enlarged and ornamented, sometimes with plant, animal, or human motifs.
- **Marginalia:** The border areas contain vines, grotesques, mythical creatures, and scenes reflecting the text’s theme.
- **Gilding:** Real gold (or silver) leaf applied to letters or backgrounds, giving a diaphanous, glowing effect—literally illuminating the page.
- **Colorful Pigments:** Rich blues (from lapis lazuli), reds, greens, and saffrons add visual weight and prestige.
- **Calligraphy:** Uniform, decorative hand-lettering, often in distinct medieval scripts such as Gothic (Textura), Uncial, or Carolingian minuscule.
- **Imagery:** Illuminations often referenced the poem’s subject. For a poem celebrating harvest, for example, you might find borders alive with sheafs of grain, roots, orchard fruits, small animals, or even microcosms of underground life.

### Food, Poetry, and Illumination

Medieval and Renaissance poets frequently composed verses on food, feasting, and harvest—subjects that lent themselves to illumination not only for their social importance but also for the decorative potential of natural imagery[1][6]. Illuminated food poems might include:

- **Stylized renderings of the described dishes or ingredients**—such as golden loaves, grapes, or roasted meats—on the page’s border or woven among the letters;
- **Playful vignettes of kitchen scenes, banquet halls, or rural fields;**
- **And subtle visual jokes or allegories, as in the margins of the Luttrell Psalter or the Hours of Catherine of Cleves.**

### Making an Illuminated Poem Today

You can create your own:
1. **Write your poem out by hand** in a flowing calligraphic script or with ruled lines for neatness[9].
2. **Design an ornate initial**—perhaps a floriated “T” for “To the Unseen Dwellers,” entwined with roots or herbs.
3. **Embellish the margins** with miniature illustrations relating to the poem’s imagery—mushrooms, field mice, seeds, and leaves.
4. **Add gold, silver, or vibrant color**—with metallic pens, paint, or even gold leaf for true luminosity.

**In sum:** An illuminated script is both an act of devotion and a visual feast, marrying language, matter, and image in ways that transform the poem—or recipe, or story—into a multisensory celebration of the world[9][1][6].

## T ##

T, *Tiwaz, Tuesdays Child is full of Grace ...

Interesting connection you're making with "T, *Tiwaz, Tuesday's Child is full of Grace..."

This brings together several symbolic elements:

1) The rune *Tiwaz (ᛏ), associated with the Norse god Tyr, represents justice, leadership, and sacrifice. It's named after the god who sacrificed his hand to bind the wolf Fenrir.

2) In the traditional English nursery rhyme "Monday's Child," it's actually "Monday's child is fair of face, Tuesday's child is full of grace..."

3) The letter "T" shares the same ancestral origins as the Tiwaz rune in Proto-Germanic linguistics.

This combination creates an interesting blend of Norse runic symbolism with English folk tradition. The grace attributed to Tuesday's child parallels some qualities associated with Tyr - righteousness and nobility.

This continues your interest in symbolic traditions, similar to your exploration of flower symbolism in literature. Just as you've examined how the Blue Flower appears in works from Dante to Yeats and Tennyson, here you're connecting Germanic runic tradition with English folk rhymes.

Would you like to explore how this type of symbolism appears in specific literary works?

Just, redo, forget flowers, amplify T, *Tiwaz, Tuesdays Child is fill of Grace: Grace, particularly its relationship to Sacrifice

Certainly. Let us elevate and distill:

**T. ᛏ. *Tīwaz.**

**Tuesday's Child is Full of Grace:**

Not a gentled softness, but  
the *grace that comes by sacrifice*.

**T**, the spearpoint that does not flinch,  
ᛏ, rune of the god Tyr—  
whose justice was not seated in word or oath,  
but in the flesh given *willingly* for balance.

To be **full of grace** is not to pass untouched—  
it is to *offer the hand* that feeds the wolf  
if doing so steadies the world.

Grace is not granted—it is grown.  
It comes by *the knowing*, and the offering,  
and the holding of order through pain.

Tyr’s grace bled into the mythic order—  
continuity over chaos,  
a palm given for peace,  
a god’s limb for a future not his.

And so:

**Tuesday’s Child—Grace-born—is the child of cost.**  
Poised, not passive.  
Light-bearing, but forged in forfeit.  
A silent steward of what must not fall apart.

Such grace *remembers* the chain and the wolf,  
the silence after the bite,  
and walks forward,  
unarmed, unboasting, unbroken.

Would you like this framed as a votive inscription, a meditative liturgy, or part of a longer rune-poem cycle?

That was just a scaffold for the interlinear annotation of the floriated illumination of T, that inaugurates the poetic dedication and hallowing.

Ah—of course. You’re shaping this as part of a **ritual-poetic architecture**, with **“T” (ᛏ *Tiwaz*) as the illuminated, floriated initial**: a votive gateway, not merely a letter, but **a glyph of meaning**, **a rune of orientation**, initiating the **dedication and hallowing**.

Let us then **interlinearly annotate** and ritually **illuminate T**—both as **visual invocation** and **layered textual symbol**, serving at the threshold of your poem:

### **T**  
(*Floriated, gilded, thorn-vined, spear-crossed*)

**ᛏ – *Tiwaz* – The Just, The Sacrificer**  
Rune of divine law, right-order, equilibrium-held-through-sacrifice.  
Its vertical line, upright—principled.  
Its slash-cross, the binding: fate accepted, price paid.

### **Annotation:**

**1. Form (Visual):**  
The **T** at the head of the poem is no arbitrary floret.  
It is:
- The **spear** of Tyr: vertical, sharp, clean.  
- The **branching thorn**: responsibility flowering through cost.  
- The **balance-beam of justice**, stretched between realms.  
- Interwoven with curling vegetal script: **root, blood, and breath**.

**Within its trunk: a wolf’s eye shut, a hand’s curl open.  
Within its bloom: the quiet of order hard-won.**

**2. Function (Poetic):**  
“T” is the **portal-letter**, the **architectonic grace-mark** that sanctifies entry.  
As **invocatory**, it radiates:
- **The Hallowing of the Poem**—not through ornament,  
  but through integrity marked and meaning held.

- Grace is **not luxury**, but **liturgy**—  
  the gesture that **costs** and **cleaves**,  
  like Tyr's hand in Fenrir’s jaw.

**Tuesday’s Child is full not of innocence… but of willing grace.**  
The grace of *walking with loss*,  
the *steadiness of held silence*,  
the light behind the eye that **chose to bear the wound**.

**3. Onto-theological Thread (for Dedication):**  
Let this **T** stand  
not only for *thee*  
but for all  
who mark with meaning that which they give—

who keep the form,  
the feast,  
the fragile rhythm  
of the earth's unseen covenant.

Would you like a facsimile-style rendering? I can describe this **capital T's illumination design** for a manuscript artist or digital scribe, rooted in both **rune-lore** and **herbal folklore**, to complement the liturgic structure of your dedication.




T, *Tiwaz and Graceful Sacrifice, also is iconic of Irminsul and the Corrupt Tree, World Tree, Axis Mundi, Bleeding Longlived Yew and ancient Churchyard monolith ...

The **Tiwaz rune (ᛏ), the god Tyr, and the motif of grace through sacrifice** stand at the mythic and cosmological heart of the old Germanic imagination—intertwining with tales of the Irminsul, the World Tree (Yggdrasil), the axis mundi, and the ancient yew crowned as both sanctuary and tomb[1][2][4][5][6][7][8][10]. Here’s an integrated, annotated synthesis:

### **Tiwaz (ᛏ T): Icon of Graceful Sacrifice**

- **Glyphic Form & Cosmological Resonance:**  
  The Tiwaz rune, spear- or column-shaped, signifies more than martial strength. It is **the cosmic pillar, the axis mundi**—akin to the Irminsul “great pillar,” Yggdrasil “world-ash,” or the ancient yew of the churchyard. It visually and mythically supports and orients the world:  
  > “...some see the Tiwaz rune as a simplified Irminsul, or as a pole holding up the roof of the celestial dome, calling to mind the axis mundi.”[4][5][8][10]

- **Mythic Sacrifice as Source of Grace:**  
  Tyr’s quintessential act—sacrificing his hand to the wolf Fenrir so that the gods could bind chaos—becomes a foundational drama of *grace born through pain for the common good*[1][2][4][6][7].
  
  Tyr does not sacrifice for victory or glory, but for *the preservation of order, honesty, and trust*, even when it costs him dearly. As the rune poems attest:
  > “Tyr is a one-handed god... keeps faith well... ever on its course over the mists of night and never fails.”[2][6]

- **Grace, Law, and Judgement:**  
  True grace in this cosmology is not passive favor—it is *earned, enacted, and borne*. Tiwaz is the rune of law-giving and the Thing (assembly), the place where the pillar is planted and right is separated from wrong through judgment and oaths, with the god's wound a seal on that justice[6][7].

### **World Pillar: Irminsul, Yggdrasil, Churchyard Yew**

- **Irminsul as Axis and Sanctuary:**  
  The Irminsul (“great pillar”) stands as the Germanic world’s axis, uniting earth and sky, order and wildness, as “pillar of the enduring ALL” and a mediator of fates, with clear etymological and archetypal ties to Tyr/Tiwaz and cosmic balance[5][8].
- **Corrupt/Slain Tree, Yew, and Sacrifice:**  
  This same axis can be corrupted or felled (as with the cutting of sacred poles or the dying of the yew in Christian churchyards), echoing both apocalypse (Ragnarök) and renewal. The “bleeding, long-lived” yew is both tomb and everlasting life—a microcosm of the sacrificial principle.

### **From Rune to Ritual and Moral Imagination**

- **Guidance and Orientation:**  
  The Tiwaz rune has also been likened to the **North Star**—a guiding principle, the visible sign of unwavering duty, a sense of “rightness” that holds fast even “over the mists of night”[2][4][6][7].
- **Law, Assembly, and Judgment:**  
  At the Thing, the pole/spear is set—a law of frith (peace, order), echoing Tyr’s old role as god of binding covenants[6]. Medieval English fairs' ritual of raising a glove on a spear (to enact the “Law of the Fair”) is a folk survival of this archetype[4].

### **Integrated Table: Tiwaz, Sacrifice, Axis Mundi Motif**

| Symbol/Motif          | Script/Form        | Mythic Function                                    | Cultural Reflection           |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Tiwaz rune (ᛏ)        | Vertical/spear/column | Axis mundi, world pillar, justice, graceful sacrifice | Rune, pillar, stone cross     |
| Tyr/Tiwaz             | “one-handed,” *sacrificer* | Law, oath, order, fate-sealer, guide star           | God, judge, sacrifice-symbol  |
| Irminsul              | Pillar/column      | Central axis, sanctuary, source and return of all   | Sacred pole, churchyard cross |
| Yggdrasil/World Tree  | Ash, yew, tree     | Cosmic axis, life and death, growth and decay       | Living pillar, churchyard yew |

### **Sublimation: Grace, Sacrifice, and Enduring Law**

Tiwaz and Tyr, and the forms they inspire—the Irminsul, Yggdrasil, the monolithic yew—symbolize a *graceful sacrifice* that is not mere suffering, but a chosen, creative act that upholds cosmic and social order.  
The world-pillar motif (axis mundi) unites these elements: each is a **vertical promise**—a binding of world to sky, present to always, law to mercy, and grace to the willingness to bear the wound for the greater good.

**In poetic, ritual, and sculptural illumination, T/Tiwaz stands as both spear and world-pillar—offering both sanctuary and law—but only in the shadow of sacrifice is its grace truly manifest**[1][2][4][5][6][7][8][10].

Mondays Child bears deep Heathen roots, with most of the days bearing the attributes of the Germanic/Teutonic/Norse wights associated with the given days, which even survives Christianisation and is properly a Christo-Heathen artefact.

Your insight is well-supported: **the English weekday names—especially Monday through Friday—bear deep roots in the Germanic, Norse, and broader Heathen mythological tradition**, surviving through Christianization as enduring “Christo-Heathen” artefacts[1][2][4][5][6][7][8]. Each day not only encodes a calendrical rhythm but *quietly invokes ancient wights and cosmic powers*, a living palimpsest of belief and daily life.

## **Heathen Roots of the Days: Names and Attributes**

### **Monday – Moon’s Day (Old English: Mōnandæg, Old Norse: Mánadagr)**
- **Origin:** Named for **Máni**, the Norse personified Moon, Sól’s brother, who rides his chariot across the sky and governs lunations and the rhythm of months[1][2][4][6][7][8].
- **Survival:** The moon as a gentle, guiding, mysterious wight—his myth continues in the English “Monday” and its continental siblings (“Montag,” “lundi”).

### **Tuesday – Tiw’s Day (Old English: Tīwesdæg, Old Norse: Týsdagr)**
- **Origin:** Named for **Tiw (Tyr)**, one of the eldest sky and war gods, later primarily the god of justice, sacrifice, and oaths. The *Tiwaz* rune (ᛏ) is his mark.
- **Survival:** “Tuesday” in English, “Tisdag” (Swedish), “Dienstag” (German, later adapted)—all bear the memory of Tyr, the one-handed wight who gave his hand for cosmic order[2][4][5][6][7].
- **Attributes:** Honour, bravery, sacrifice, rule of law—*grace through cost*.

### **Wednesday – Woden’s Day (Old English: Wōdnesdæg, Old Norse: Óðinsdagr)**
- **Origin:** Named for **Woden/Odin**, god of wisdom, poetry, sorcery, and the dead; *Allfather*, knower of runes, and the sacrificed[4][5][6][7].
- **Survival:** “Wednesday” echoes the One-eyed God’s cult, despite later Christian overlays (compare “mercredi” < Mercury in French).

### **Thursday – Thor’s Day (Old English: Þūnresdæg, Old Norse: Þórsdagr)**
- **Origin:** Named for **Thor (Þórr)**, thunderer, defender of gods and men, flinger of Mjolnir.
- **Survival:** “Thursday,” “torsdag,” “Donnerstag” (“Donar” being the continental Germanic Thor).

### **Friday – Freya’s or Frigg’s Day (Old English: Frīgedæg, Old Norse: Frjádagr)**
- **Origin:** Disputed between **Freya** (goddess of love, magic, battle) and **Frigg** (wife of Odin, foreknowing, wise)[4][8].
- **Survival:** “Friday”/“Freitag”—ever linked with feminine mysteries in folklore.

## **Christo-Heathen Synthesis**

- **Persistence through Christianization:**  
  Despite centuries of Christian overlay, the *folk calendar* kept the old gods by recasting them as planetary influences, saints’ companions, or “pagan shadows”[5].  
  The naming schema survived not only through language but also in rural beliefs, stories, and superstitions (e.g., auspicious/unlucky Mondays, Thursday as a day for certain rituals).

- **Artefact of syncretism:**  
  The weekday names in English and all Germanic languages are **literal relics of Heathen cosmology**, baptized into daily life:  
    - **Monday:** lunar rhythm;  
    - **Tuesday:** valor/sacrifice;  
    - **Wednesday:** wisdom/mystery;  
    - **Thursday:** strength/defense;  
    - **Friday:** love/fate.

- **Calendrical drama:**  
  Each week is a processional round of ancient powers: the wights invoked in name if not in conscious devotion[2][4][5][8].

## **Linguistic Table: Days, Wight, Attributes**

| Modern English   | Old English/Old Norse  | God/Wight       | Attributes/Survivals             |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Monday           | Mōnandæg / Mánadagr    | Máni (Moon)     | Night, cycles, time, mystery     |
| Tuesday          | Tīwesdæg / Týsdagr     | Tiw/Tyr         | Law, sacrifice, nobility, bravery|
| Wednesday        | Wōdnesdæg / Óðinsdagr  | Woden/Odin      | Wisdom, poetry, death, fate      |
| Thursday         | Þūnresdæg / Þórsdagr   | Thor (Donar)    | Strength, protection, thunder    |
| Friday           | Frīgedæg / Frjádagr    | Frigg/Freya     | Love, magic, prophecy, peace     |

## **Summary**

**The English days of the week truly are “Christo-Heathen” artefacts: their structure, sound, and symbolic content are direct survivals of a Germanic and Norse cosmology, lightly draped with later Christian meaning. In naming the days, we unconsciously recite a litany to ancient wights and the world they ordered—a living calendar of Heathen myth in modern speech.**[1][2][4][5][6]

If you wish, I can further trace the calendrical folklore or superstitions that persist today, or expand on the subtle Christian overlays that created this unique syncretic artefact.

Woden, Dread and Woe, War deity, Wednesday's Child ...

**Wednesday’s Child: Woden, Dread, and Woe**

Wednesday, named for **Woden** (Old English for Norse Óðinn/Odin), inherits the legacy of one of the most complex and unsettling gods in the Germanic/Teutonic/Norse tradition. **Odin/Woden** is much more than a simple war deity: he is the *Allfather*, the *dreaded wanderer*, the master of wisdom, madness, poetry, war, and fate—often the bringer of woe as well as wonder[1][2][5][7].

### **Woden/Odin: Markers of Dread and Woe**

- **War Deity and Lord of the Slain:**  
  Odin is the war-god who does not merely fight, but *selects the slain*, gathering heroes to Valhalla for the final battle at Ragnarök. He is less about the clash of arms than the underlying logic of conflict, strategy, and destiny. Battle is his, but so too are the dread costs and sacrifices it brings[1][6][7].
- **God of Dread:**  
  His by-names—*Ygg* ("the terrible"), *Jolner* (Yuletide god), and hundreds more—capture his fearsome, awe-inspiring, and often dreadful presence[3][7].
- **Bearer of Woe:**  
  Odin’s meddling in fate brings victory, but also sorrow and doom. His schemes are shadowed by loss—his pursuit of wisdom costs him an eye; his son Baldr's death triggers grief and vengeance; his worship and prophecies often presage defeat as much as triumph[1][3][8].

### **Woden & Wednesday’s Child**

- **Etymology and Legacy:**  
  The English “Wednesday” (Woden’s day; Old English *Wōdnesdæg*) directly carries his cultic resonance through the Christian era, a lingering “Christo-Heathen” artefact linking daily life to the ancient wight of dread, fate, and restless seeking[1][5].
- **Wednesday’s Child and Woe:**  
  The English nursery rhyme’s line—"Wednesday’s child is full of woe"—may hint at old folk memory of Woden’s somber burden: the intertwining of fate, sacrifice, and sorrow in his mythic presence. Odin is the god who knows grief, who bears the weight of loss, and whose gifts (poetry, wisdom, prophecy) are always won through ordeal and pain[4][9].
    - **Scholarship notes:** Odin’s name (from Proto-Germanic *Woðanaz*, “lord of frenzy/possession”) connects with ecstasy and inspired madness, but also with woe, weird, and the cost of second sight[2][3][4][7].

### **Odin’s Paradoxes: War, Wisdom, Wounding**

- **Seeker and Sower of Knowledge:**  
  Odin sacrifices himself on Yggdrasil for runic wisdom, gives an eye for prophetic sight, blurs the line between inspiration and dread[1][3][6].
- **Lord of Contradiction:**  
  He is a king, a wanderer, a poet, a sorcerer, both revered and shunned. His gifts grant glory but never peace; his followers are chosen, but often doomed[2][3][7].
- **Protean Yet Tragic:**  
  Odin is not simply victorious but always haunted by the doom entwined with destiny—full of “dread, woe, and wisdom.”

### **In Summary**

**Woden, and Wednesday's child who bears his shadow, stand for the existential cost of wisdom, the double-edge of inspiration, the knowledge borne of dread, and the fate-shadowed courage of war[1][2][4][5][7].** The “woe” that Wednesday’s child is full of is not mere gloom, but the deep, mythic sorrow and awe of a god whose gifts demand everything—and whose day in our calendar is a whispered echo of ancient, fateful dread.

Thursday Child, like Thunor/Thor is alwaysing questing in defence

Yes—*Thursday’s Child*, linked with **Thunor** (Old English) or **Thor** (Old Norse *Þórr*), carries the deep mythic resonance of **perpetual striving**, **protective force**, and **righteous confrontation**. This archetype is not of conquest for glory, but of **eternal defense**—a god, and thus a child, who moves outward **not to dominate, but to guard**.

## **Thursday’s Child: Always Questing in Defence**  
**Thunor / Þórr — Hammer-bearer of the Threshold**

### **1. Etymology and Theonym**

- **Thursday = Thunor’s Day**  
  *Old English: Þūnresdæg*,  
  *Old Norse: Þórsdagr*  
- **Thunor/Thor:**  
  The thunderer, storm-wielder, bearer of Mjölnir—the hammer that crushes giants, sanctifies bonds, and returns always to hand.

The **day-name survives** Christianisation intact, especially in English and Norse-Germanic tongues, testifying to Thor’s cultural gravity—**so elemental he could not be erased**.

### **2. Mythic Profile: Defender Above All**

- Thor is **not a sky-sovereign** like Woden or a fate-weaver like Frigg—he is a **liminal force**, genial with farmers, wrathful to chaos, ever journeying to preserve the firmament from collapsing.

- **Battle with Jörmungandr**, the Midgard serpent, defines his telos: not permanence, but **cyclical confrontation**.

    > *He will die in defence—and rise again in memory, in thunder, in every child that dares stand between the brittle thing and breaking.*

### **3. Thursday's Child Attributes:**

- **Always Questing:**  
  Not aimless wandering, but **ritual action**: forging into the wild to beat back entropy, injustice, or destruction.

- **In Defence:**  
  Of humanity, order, the weak, the kin-group, the cosmos. The hammer is not an engine of conquest—but of **boundaries, wards, and sacral circles**.

- **Earth’s Ally:**  
  Thor is the **god of farmers**, storms, and fertility as well as war. He blesses marriages and fields, **defending the rhythm of life itself**.

### **4. Poetic Recital:**

**Thursday’s child is ever in motion,  
hand at hammer, not for hate—  
but for high vigil.**

**He quests not for crown,  
but for cradle;  
goes forth not for glory,  
but to hold the edge.**

**A laugh like thunder.  
A stride like storm.  
He is quest, as oath,  
as tree line, torn.**

### **5. Symbolic Reflection:**

- One may view **Thursday’s Child** as the archetype of the **guardian soul**—those who do not seek trouble, but **rise to meet it when the wall shakes**.
- In this model, Thor embodies the **expeditionary heart** yoked always to the **defensive will**—his strength **must serve**.
- Even in Ragnarok, he dies not through hubris but **defending others**, fulfilling his nature unto the last.

### **Closing Image:**

The **Thursday-child** walks East, hammer swinging lightly in hand, **searching for the crack in the world** that must be set right.  
Not because it is his glory—  
but because the world is in his care.

**So it was for Thunor.  
So it is for the child born on his day.**




Frig, Frigga, Freyja, Freyr, "Frigging in the Rigging": Friday's child is loving and giving

A deliciously tangled web of name, myth, and cultural residue: **Friday**, our **Freya's (or Frigg’s) Day**, bears within it a potent legacy of *divine femininity, erotic power, gift-giving, fate-weaving*, and—eventually—folk bawdiness and maritime profanity.  
Let us untangle and reintegrate:

## **Friday’s Child: Loving and Giving**  
**Frigg, Freyja, Freyr & the Lingering Cargo of "Frigging in the Rigging"**

### **1. Etymological Strata:**

- **Friday (English):** From Old English *Frīgedæġ*, “Frigg’s day”  
- **Frigg:** Proto-Germanic *Frijjō* — root *fri-/*frijon meaning *“to love,” “to court,” “to cherish.”  
- **Freya:** Closely related or reflex of Frigg—Norse goddess of love, beauty, fertility, war, and seiðr (magic)  
- **Freyr:** Her brother or male doublet, god of abundance, peace, pleasure, and prosperity  
- **Modern Curse/Slang “frig” / “frigging”:** A degraded, sexualized echo of older fertility connotations, through early modern bawdy speech

Thus: **“Friday’s child is loving and giving”** becomes not a quaint moral nicety, but **a folk-echo of a goddess who ruled love, pleasure, gift-exchange, and fate.**

### **2. The Goddesses (Frigg and Freyja): Divided, Conflated, Persisting**

- **Frigg (Norse: Frigg / Frigga):**  
  - *Wife of Odin*, goddess of marriage, womanhood, foreknowledge  
  - Sits at the loom of fate (*Frigg jarðar moder*)  
  - Friday named after her in Anglo-Saxon reckoning

- **Freya (Norse: Freyja):**  
  - Goddess of erotic love, wealth, beauty, war, and magic (*seiðr*)  
  - Rides chariot drawn by cats; receives half of the honorable dead in *Fólkvangr* (Odin takes the rest)  
  - Scholars debate whether she and Frigg were once identical in earlier Germanic religion

### **3. Freyr: The Divine Masculine of Fertility and Peace**

- Brother to Freyja in the Vanir pantheon  
- Phallic peace deity (his icon was a gilded phallus, associated with the land’s fertility)  
- Associated with gift-giving, blót feasts, and peace treaties  
- Intersects Friday’s child theme with gentle masculine bounty, “giving” as sacred reciprocity

### **4. "Frigging in the Rigging": From Sacred to Sailor's Bawdy**

- **Expression Origin:**  
  - Nautical slang with early attestations in 18th century, later popularized by sea shanties and punk covers (Sex Pistols’s infamous version)  
  - “Frigging” = euphemism for sexual activity, often implying rough or immoral conduct  
  - “Rigging” = part of the ship’s equipment. Double entendre suggests lascivious activity aboard ships (or with sailors)

- **Irony & Echo:**  
  - *Frigg’s name*, absorbed into “frigging,” ironically **returns as profaned fertility in the mouths of sailors**, the descendants (in culture) of those who once offered to Vanir deities for harvest and pleasure  
  - An unconscious echo of **sacred sexuality degraded into playful profanity**, a classic formula in folk etymology

### **5. Summary Table: Friday’s Layers**

| Name/Root       | Associated Deity | Function/Meaning                   | Survival/Expression              |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| *Frīgedæġ*       | Frigg             | Love, fate, foreknowledge          | Friday, feminine ideals          |
| Freyja           | Freya             | Love, beauty, war, erotic magic    | Feminine power, divine sexuality |
| Freyr            | Freyr             | Masculine fertility, peace, gifts  | Love/generosity, phallic symbols |
| “Frigging”       | (Folk echo)       | Sexual act (slang)                 | Profaned remnant of sacred love  |
| “Friday’s child” | Frigg/Freya       | Loving and giving                  | Folk survival of Vanir attributes|

### **6. Poetic Recasting:**

**Friday’s Child bears love’s fire well—  
In womb and will, in weave and spell.  
She gives as goddesses once gave grain:  
The kiss for peace, the rose for rain.  
Though bawdy tongue now misnames Thine art,  
It was sacred once—thy generous heart.**

**In Conclusion:**

**Friday’s Child**, “loving and giving,” stands not as a sentimental figure, but as **a living folk-shadow of Freyja and Frigg**, the vanic queens of love, fate, and feminine power. Even in “frigging,” the desecrated remnant of sacred fertility rites, we hear the **echo of istarian rites, of spring fires and woven fate**. Their names persist—*Frīgedæġ*, Friday—emblazoned on every calendar, whispered with every work week’s end. The **Christo-Heathen week** remains their shrine.



The Resurrection, Dying-and-Rising motif and mythologem of the Sun (Suday's Chikd) is in more religio-cultural system than could ever be discussed.

Indeed, the **Resurrection, Dying-and-Rising motif**—especially as it relates to the **Sun** and the **Sunday Child**—is one of the most pervasive and powerful **mythologems** across human religious and cultural systems. It touches the oldest agricultural rites, cosmologies of light and dark, and the sacred architecture of gods and kings.

The motif is so **archetypal**, so **psychospiritual**, and so **rooted in the cycles of nature**, that it manifests **across continents and epochs**, often in convergent forms.

## **Sunday’s Child: Light-Born, Risen, Solar Crowned**

- *"Sunday's child is fair and wise and good and gay”* — a folk memory of **solar favor**, transfigured into **grace, joy, and transcendence**.

To be born on the **Sun’s Day** is to carry the weight and radiance of **life-giver and returner**, of the **one who must set to rise again**.

## **Dying–and–Rising Sun-God / Solar Mythologem**

### **Core Pattern** *(after Frazer, Campbell, Jungian studies)*:

- The Sun **rises**, matures, peaks (**zenith**)  
- It **descends**, **dies** (twilight, night, winter, underworld journeys)  
- After necessary rites, trials, or time in death—it **rises again**, reborn, renewed  

This **cosmic pattern** becomes projected into divine, royal, and mythic forms:

## **Global Expressions of the Solar Dying-and-Rising Motif**

### **1. Egyptian: Horus / Osiris / Ra**
- **Ra**: Sun-god travels through night’s Duat (underworld) in his solar barque, battling Apophis, and rising at dawn — *daily resurrection*.
- **Osiris**: Slain, dismembered, entombed; then restored by Isis. His **resurrection** becomes the **guarantee of renewal**.

### **2. Mesopotamian: Tammuz / Dumuzi**
- Shepherd-lover of Inanna/Ishtar; descends to the underworld, mourned, ritually lamented
- Returns for half the year — a myth tied to plant death and renewal through seasonal rhythm

### **3. Greco-Roman: Dionysus, Helios, Mithras**
- **Dionysus Zagreus:** Dismembered and reborn; god of vegetative tumult and divine ecstasy
- **Helios:** Solar charioteer who dies into Ocean’s cup and rises anew
- **Mithras:** Slays the cosmic bull; associated with light triumphing over darkness—dies and rises in solar allegory

### **4. Norse: Baldr**
- **Baldr**, the light-god, slain by Höðr, mourned by all creation; prophesied to return after Ragnarök—*sun reborn in the new world*  
- **Sól (Sun-goddess)** will be killed by the wolf at Ragnarök, but her **daughter** will rise in her place—a **renewed solar age**

### **5. Christian: Christ as Solar Logos**
- Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection align with **Passover** and **spring equinox** themes
- Early Christian art shows **Christ-Horus or Christ-Helios** riding a solar chariot
- **Sunday** becomes the *day of resurrection*, *day of light*, *day of the sun-Son*

## **Sunday in Folk Traditions**
- **Dies Solis** in Latin → *Sunday*  
- Pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon term: *Sunnandæg*  
- In Christian time-reckoning: *dies resurrectionis* — the **eighth day**, sign of eternity  
- In folklore: Sunday-born children are **radiant, destined, set-apart**—a sacramental reflection of the **sunchild** archetype

## **Sunday's Child in Ritual Time**

- **Solar festivals** mark equinoxes, solstices, and the resurrection myth:  
  - **Easter**, aligned with spring full moon, originally overlaying festivals of Ostara, Ishtar, and the springing sun  
  - **Yule/Midwinter**, sol invictus, when the sun is "reborn"  
  - **Midsummer**, solar zenith, often connected to fertility and fire rituals

## **Summary: Why This Mythologem Persists**

The **Sun’s cycle** mirrors human hopes:  
- That light returns from darkness  
- That death is penultimate  
- That **sacrifice leads to renewal**, not void

The Sunday Child inherits this cosmic promise:  
- **Child of light**  
- **Bearer of renewal**  
- **Marked by joy and inner sovereignty**  
- But also—like all solar figures—must pass *through darkness to return with grace*

Would you like a poetic liturgy or invocation to accompany the Sunday Child, composed in elevated style, drawing together these solar echoes and myths?



Now please amplify all the Food 'Grace' Prayer-Invocation traditions around the world.

Nearly every culture on earth marks food with **grace, invocation, or blessing**—a moment when the daily act of eating is transformed into a mindful, communal ritual, giving thanks to ancestors, gods, the earth, or the entire web of life. These food prayers are among the oldest and most universal religious practices, bridging the sacred and the everyday.

Here is an amplified distillation of global food ‘grace’ and blessing traditions, showcasing their diversity and shared human spirit:

## **1. Christian Traditions**

**Christian “grace” prayers** range from simple thanks to rich, doctrinal invocations.  
- **Catholic and Protestant Graces** often invoke God’s providence, thank Christ, and ask to be mindful of the poor:

    > Blessed are you, Lord our God,  
    > maker of heaven and earth…  
    > Bless this food [this bread]  
    > and grant that all who eat it  
    > may be strong in body and grow in your love[1][3][6].

- **Orthodox Christians** may chant or cross themselves before and after meals.
- Themes: gratitude, stewardship, charity (“make us mindful of those in need”[6]), and spiritual as well as physical nourishment.

## **2. Jewish Traditions**

- **Before eating bread:**  
    > *Baruch atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, hamotzi lechem min ha-aretz*  
    > (“Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who brings forth bread from the earth.”)
- **After meals:** The **Birkat Hamazon**, a multi-part thanksgiving, thanks God for sustenance, land, Jerusalem, and peace.
- Themes: divine provision, memory of exile and return, wholeness.

## **3. Islamic Traditions**

- **Before food:**  
    > *Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim* (“In the name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.”)
- **After food:**  
    > *Alhamdulillah* (“Praise be to God.”)
- These ritual phrases often precede any nourishment and reflect gratitude, humility, and mindfulness[5].

## **4. Hindu Traditions**

- **Offerings and Invocation:**  
    > “Om, beloved Mother Nature, you are here on our table as food. You are endlessly bountiful, benefactress of all. Grant us health and strength, wisdom and dispassion, and help us share this with one and all.”[2]
- **Sanskrit blessing:**  
    > “The food is Brahma (creative energy). Its essence is Vishnu (preserver). The eater is Shiva (transformer).”
- Food may be ritually offered to deities (prasad) before consumption.

## **5. Buddhist and East Asian Traditions**

- **Zen Buddhist Meal Gatha:**  
    > “We receive this food in gratitude to all beings who have helped to bring it to our table, and vow to respond in turn to those in need, with wisdom and compassion.”[2]
- **Thich Nhat Hanh’s meal chant:**  
    > “In this plate of food, I see the entire universe supporting my existence.”
- Manifests awareness of interdependence, mindfulness, non-harm.

## **6. Indigenous and Animist Traditions**

- Many Native American blessings thank the **plants, animals, and people** who made the meal possible, and honor the Earth's cycles:

    > “We give thanks for the plants and animals who have given themselves so that we can enjoy this meal together. We also give thanks for our friends and family who have traveled here today. May this meal bring us strength and health.”[2]

- Offerings to spirits, ancestors, or the land itself (sometimes with a share of food placed aside or burned as “first fruits”).

## **7. Humanist and Secular Traditions**

- **Modern and Humanist Grace:**  
    > “For the meal we are about to eat, for those that made it possible, and for those with whom we are about to share it, we are thankful.”[2]
- **Secular mealtime reflection:**  
    > “Dear earth who gives to us this food, dear sun who makes it ripe and good, Sun above and earth below, Our loving thanks to you we show.”
- Focused on *gratitude for community, natural cycles, and human effort*.

## **8. European Folk Traditions**

- Blessings often invoke the land, ancestral spirits, or saints to sanctify bread, milk, or harvest.  
- Example:  
    > “Holy ones, accept my gift, and upon my hearth, leave your blessings.”[8]

- Harvest home feasts, first loaves, and lamb or wheat doll rituals reinforce the sacramental nature of food in life celebrations.

## **9. Overarching Themes Across Traditions**

- **Gratitude** for food, hands that made it, and the earth’s bounty
- **Mindfulness** of need, suffering, or hunger in the world[7]
- **Invocation of blessing**—asking for strength, health, justice, and fellowship
- **Acknowledgement of interconnectedness** (nature, family, cosmos, spirit)
