# Dedication #

To that upon which we subsist:  
To the [wights](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wight&oldid=1292146887) that supporteth life.

## A Hallowing & Poetic Fancy: To Mote & Morsel ##

To the Unseen Dwellers: Root and Runner,  
Soil’s Intelligence and earthen Breath —  
Mushroom and Mite, Microbe and Mineral,  
all that seethe beneath Our step.

To the Rain-shaded splay of Leaves,  
the pulse of Sap down vascular Green,  
the Fruit that’s lifted and the Seed and Nut that drops,  
the Low-born, Foraging, Sky-making Kin.

To the storied beasts: Hoof and Wing,  
to Fur, to Shell; to the silent, blinking Life  
that Grazes dusk and is gathered,  
to the Honeyed labour and the Blood unspoken.

To the ancient Pulse of Yeast and Fire,  
to the Blade, the Berry, the Leavening crust,  
to all that once drew Breath  
and all who Break and Bless.

To the Chorus of Sustenance, Wild and Humble,  
Wights in the Unseen Parliament of Earth:  
without Thee, Our feasts are hollow,  
Our days, unbuttered.

*This is a poetic invocation in the tradition of food poetry—echoing the mode of Pablo Neruda’s "Ode to the Onion," Robert Frost’s "Blueberries," Virgil’s "Salad," and the bread and fruit verses of classic English and American writers[5][6][7]. It draws on an animist sense of gratitude towards the vital but often-unseen presences—the “wights” or spirits—supporting the chain of nourishment that sustains mortal life.*

## Artisanal To-Do ##

### An Illumination ###

**Illuminated Script** refers to the art form of hand-lettered manuscripts—often from the medieval and early modern eras—decorated with gold or silver leaf, vibrant pigments, and intricate borders, initials, and miniature illustrations. Such works are commonly found in religious texts (like psalters, Books of Hours, and bibles), as well as in poetry and culinary manuscripts[9].

### Core Features of Illuminated Script

- **Elaborate Initials:** The first letter of a stanza or paragraph is enlarged and ornamented, sometimes with plant, animal, or human motifs.
- **Marginalia:** The border areas contain vines, grotesques, mythical creatures, and scenes reflecting the text’s theme.
- **Gilding:** Real gold (or silver) leaf applied to letters or backgrounds, giving a diaphanous, glowing effect—literally illuminating the page.
- **Colorful Pigments:** Rich blues (from lapis lazuli), reds, greens, and saffrons add visual weight and prestige.
- **Calligraphy:** Uniform, decorative hand-lettering, often in distinct medieval scripts such as Gothic (Textura), Uncial, or Carolingian minuscule.
- **Imagery:** Illuminations often referenced the poem’s subject. For a poem celebrating harvest, for example, you might find borders alive with sheafs of grain, roots, orchard fruits, small animals, or even microcosms of underground life.

### Food, Poetry, and Illumination

Medieval and Renaissance poets frequently composed verses on food, feasting, and harvest—subjects that lent themselves to illumination not only for their social importance but also for the decorative potential of natural imagery[1][6]. Illuminated food poems might include:

- **Stylized renderings of the described dishes or ingredients**—such as golden loaves, grapes, or roasted meats—on the page’s border or woven among the letters;
- **Playful vignettes of kitchen scenes, banquet halls, or rural fields;**
- **And subtle visual jokes or allegories, as in the margins of the Luttrell Psalter or the Hours of Catherine of Cleves.**

### Making an Illuminated Poem Today

You can create your own:
1. **Write your poem out by hand** in a flowing calligraphic script or with ruled lines for neatness[9].
2. **Design an ornate initial**—perhaps a floriated “T” for “To the Unseen Dwellers,” entwined with roots or herbs.
3. **Embellish the margins** with miniature illustrations relating to the poem’s imagery—mushrooms, field mice, seeds, and leaves.
4. **Add gold, silver, or vibrant color**—with metallic pens, paint, or even gold leaf for true luminosity.

**In sum:** An illuminated script is both an act of devotion and a visual feast, marrying language, matter, and image in ways that transform the poem—or recipe, or story—into a multisensory celebration of the world[9][1][6].
