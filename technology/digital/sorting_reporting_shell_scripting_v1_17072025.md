Is there a way I can tag recipes, like one does in ObsidianMD, where I have many recipes currently, for quick sorting and quick GenAI access and shell script reportage?

## Tagging Recipes for Fast Sorting, GenAI Query, and Shell Script Reporting

You can structure and tag recipes in plaintext or Markdown—mirroring ObsidianMD’s method—to enable rapid sorting, AI retrieval, and programmatic (shell) reporting, especially if your recipes are stored in a repository (e.g., GitHub, local directory).

### 1. Tagging in Markdown/Plaintext

- **Inline Hashtags:**  
  Use `#tag` anywhere in your recipe files, e.g.,  
  `#fish #smoked #Scottish #seafood #pescatarian #AllergenFish`

- **YAML Front Matter (preferred for automation):**  
  Place structured metadata at the top of each recipe:
  ```markdown
  ---
  title: Scottish Kippers with Celeriac Purée
  tags: [fish, smoked, Scottish, winter, pescatarian, gluten-free]
  allergens: [fish]
  region: [Northern Britain]
  ---
  ```
  This structure is highly scriptable and friendly for both search and automation[4][5].

### 2. Sorting and Searching via Shell/Scripts

You can extract and sort recipes with basic tools:

- **Search by Tag:**  
  `grep -ril "#smoked" ./recipes/`  
  or, for YAML front matter:  
  `grep -ril "smoked" ./recipes/ | xargs grep -l "tags:"`

- **List Recipes by Allergen:**  
  `grep -ril "AllergenFish" ./recipes/`

- **Parse Metadata for Reporting:**  
  Use `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, or `yq` (for YAML) to generate summary tables or counts.

### 3. GenAI and Quick Reference

Consistent tagging enables context-aware queries in GenAI environments. For best results:

- Use a strict, documented set of tags.
- Place tags both inline (for rapid manual search) and in YAML (for machine/tooling/AI workflows).
- Include specific categories, region, dietary suitability, allergens, and any culinary taxonomies relevant to your project.

### 4. Cookbook Tagging Schema Example

| Field      | Example Value                          | Purpose                               |
|------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| tags       | [fish, smoked, Scottish, winter]       | General search, sorting               |
| allergens  | [fish, mollusc]                        | Dietary reporting/filtering           |
| region     | [Northern Britain]                     | Geographic/cultural context           |
| dietary    | [pescatarian, keto, gluten-free]       | Suitability for dietary patterns      |

### 5. Integration with Existing Tools

- This tagging approach is natively compatible with ObsidianMD, Jekyll sites, and platforms like Nextcloud Cookbook, Mealie, or TandoorRecipes[2][4][5].
- You can rapidly extend it to GenAI pipelines for automated sorting, smart recipe recommendations, or context-enriched querying.

**Summary:**  
Employ ObsidianMD-style hashtags and/or structured YAML metadata at the top of each recipe for robust, fast sorting, shell access, and seamless GenAI readiness. This method is proven in open-source recipe tools and supports both manual and automated workflows[2][4][5].
