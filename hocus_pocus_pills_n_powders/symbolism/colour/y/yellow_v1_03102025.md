# Yellow #

## Chinese ##

Absolutely — this is one of those cases where aesthetic technology, cosmology, and political authority converge into a single material protocol. Let’s unpack it carefully:

---

🌕 Why Yellow?
- In Chinese cosmology ([Wu Xing / Five Phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wuxing_(Chinese_philosophy)&oldid=1313878320)), yellow corresponds to the Earth element and the centre of the cosmos.  
- The Emperor, as the Son of Heaven (天子, tiānzǐ), was positioned at the cosmic centre, mediating between Heaven and Earth.  
- Thus, yellow became the exclusive chromatic sign of centrality, stability and supreme authority.

---

🏯 Imperial Regulation
- From the Ming dynasty onward, the use of imperial yellow (明黄, míng huáng) was strictly codified.  
- Only the Emperor, Empress, and sometimes the Crown Prince could use yellow in robes, architecture and ritual objects.  
- On porcelain, yellow glaze was reserved for the Imperial Household; unauthorized use was punishable as a direct challenge to imperial authority.  

---

🏺 Porcelain Technology
- Produced at the imperial kilns of [Jingdezhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingdezhen), yellow-glazed porcelain represented the pinnacle of technical mastery.  
- Achieving a flawless, egg-yolk yellow (jihuang 霁黄) required precise control of iron-based glazes and firing conditions: Even slight deviations produced muddy tones. Entire batches could be destroyed if they failed to meet imperial standards.  
- The glaze was often applied over a high-fired underglaze, giving it a luminous, jade-like depth.  

---

🌐 Symbolic Deployment
- Architecture: The Forbidden City’s roofs are famously covered in yellow glazed tiles, visually proclaiming imperial centrality.  
- Ceremonial objects: Yellow-glazed porcelain bowls, dishes, and ritual vessels were used in court ceremonies, reinforcing the Emperor’s cosmic role.  
- Contrast with other colours: Temples dedicated to different cosmic forces used other hues (e.g., red for the Temple of the Sun, blue for the Temple of Heaven), but yellow was always the Emperor’s alone.

📚 Archival Definition (Protocol-Ready)
Imperial Yellow Glaze: A high-temperature iron-based glaze perfected at Jingdezhen, reserved exclusively for the Emperor and his household from the [Ming dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty) onward. Symbolically tied to the Earth element and cosmic centrality, its use on porcelain, architecture, and ritual objects functioned as a visible manifestation of imperial legitimacy. Unauthorized use was treated as usurpation of imperial authority.

---

So in short: yellow glaze was not just a color, but a cosmic‑political technology — a way of materializing the Emperor’s unique position at the center of “All Under Heaven.”  

Would you like me to set this into a correspondence table (Cosmology → Political Authority → Material Technology → Ritual Deployment), so you can archive it alongside your other cultural protocols?

Yes — you’re referring to the famous “Bainbridge vase” sale of 2010, which shocked the art world. Here’s the story in protocol‑ready detail:

---

🏺 The Bainbridge Vase

- Object: A Qianlong period (c. 1740) yangcai reticulated, double‑walled porcelain vase, with underglaze blue six‑character reign mark.  
- Provenance: Believed to have been looted from the Yuanmingyuan (Old Summer Palace) in Beijing during the Anglo‑French invasion of 1860.  
- Rediscovery: Sat in a family loft in Pinner, north‑west London, for decades. It had once been dismissed on a 1970s BBC antiques show as a “clever reproduction” worth only ~£800.  

---

💰 The Sale
- Auction House: Bainbridges, a small provincial firm in Ruislip, West London.  
- Date: November 2010.  
- Estimate: £800,000 – £1.2 million.  
- Hammer Price: £43 million.  
- With Premium & VAT: ~£53 million (≈ USD $83 million at the time).  
- Significance:  
  - At the time, the most expensive piece of Chinese art ever sold at auction.  
  - By far the highest price ever achieved by a provincial UK auction house.  
  - Became a symbol of the surging Chinese art market and repatriation demand.

📚 Archival Definition
Bainbridge Vase (Lot 800, 2010): A Qianlong imperial yangcai reticulated vase, sold at Bainbridges auction house in Ruislip for £43m hammer (£53m with fees), setting a world record for Chinese porcelain. Its trajectory — from attic obscurity and mis‑valuation to record‑breaking sale — exemplifies the volatility of global art markets and the symbolic power of Qing imperial objects in contemporary Chinese cultural politics.

So yes, “circa 40 million pounds” is right in the ballpark — the hammer was £43m, but the total paid was closer to £53m.  

Would you like me to set this into a comparative table (Object → Provenance → Estimate → Hammer → Total → Significance) so you can archive it alongside your other cultural‑material protocols?
