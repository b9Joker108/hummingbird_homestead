# Introduction #

I am not sure exactly why I have commenced this first level or first order directory/file. I feel, it is less apothecary/store oriented and more the point of entry for magico-intentional, mystical, trance, ritual, meditation, bodywork and shamanic homesteading meta-processes and triangulation of knowledges instantiated into actions and actionables. Yet to be determined. Therefore, it will intersect with other repositories. Hummingbird Homestead is more sedentary and ground or base oriented thematically, whilst Hummingbird is more about what may go with, aestheticisms, worldview, bodywork, technology, portable preparednessv all that is not home-base oroented.
