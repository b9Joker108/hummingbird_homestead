# Introduction #

I am not sure exactly why I have commenced this first level or first order directory/file. I feel, it is less apothecary/store oriented and more the point of entry for magico-intentional, mystical, trance, ritual, meditation, bodywork and shamanic homesteading meta-processes and triangulation of knowledges instantiated into actions and actionables. Yet to be determined. Therefore, it will intersect with other repositories.
