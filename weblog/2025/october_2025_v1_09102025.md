[Bhajana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhajan) (Sanskrit) has interior denotations for the Gaudiya Vaishnava, in particular, that are not readily apparent through perusing a standard Sanskrit dictionary. A very important Dharmic paradigm is: Outer (External), Inner (mind's eye, thpughts, mind, visualisations, etc.) and Secret. This in various is event throughout a vast number of Dharmic Traditions. My lifepath is currently focussed upon bringing Secret- and Inner-Bhajana, into the (apparently) External realm (in contradistinction to one's, seemingly, interiority self). Many, many years ago, I created, populated and defensibly cited the following English Wikipedia Article:

Today, I traditionally, ritually installed a penant or banner of one of the evocations of the Sri Ashtamangala and post-installation, rendered traditional puja. This should be understood as theurgy and is subsumed within the purview of Bhajana.
