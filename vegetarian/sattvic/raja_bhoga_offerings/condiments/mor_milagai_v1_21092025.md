# Mor Milagai (மோர் மிளகாய் / mōr miḷakāy) #

1. Terminology and Etymology

மோர் (mōr) “buttermilk”  
- IAST: mōr  
- Lay pronunciation: “mohr”  
- Academic phonetics: [moːɾ]  
Derived from Proto-Dravidian *mōṟu, referring to sour-fermented dairy.

மிளகாய் (miḷakāy) “chilli pepper”  
- IAST: miḷakāy  
- Lay pronunciation: “mil-ah-kaay”  
- Academic phonetics: [mɪɻəkaːj]  
From Sanskrit मरीचिका (marīcikā), originally “black pepper,” later applied to Capsicum spp.

Mor Milagai thus literally means “buttermilk-chilli.”

2. Historicity and Development

Southern India’s sun-drying of chillies dates to at least medieval Tamilakam agrarian records, where surplus Capsicum harvests were preserved in open courtyards. Over centuries, coastal Kerala and Karnataka adapted the practice, combining freshly churned curds (mōr) with powdered sun-dried chillies as a cooling accompaniment. By the 17th century, Chettinad cookbooks refer to mor milagai as a staple peppery relish to balance rich coconut gravies.
