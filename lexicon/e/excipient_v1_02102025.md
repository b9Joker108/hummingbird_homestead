# Excipient #

An excipient is any substance in a pharmaceutical product that is not the active drug itself, but is intentionally included in the formulation to support the drug’s delivery, stability or usability.  

🔍 Key Points
- Role: Excipients act as carriers, stabilizers, or enhancers for the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).  
- Functions:  
  - Improve drug absorption or solubility  
  - Provide bulk to tablets or capsules (fillers, diluents)  
  - Bind ingredients together (binders)  
  - Control disintegration and release (disintegrants, coatings)  
  - Prevent sticking during manufacture (lubricants, antiadherents)  
  - Enhance stability (antioxidants, preservatives)  
  - Improve taste, color, or appearance (flavorings, colorants)  
- Regulation: Excipients must be evaluated for safety and are listed in pharmacopeias (USP, Ph. Eur., JP).  
- Misconception: Once thought “inactive,” excipients can influence how a drug behaves in the body (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics).  

📚 Example
- Magnesium stearate → lubricant to prevent tablets sticking to machinery.  
- Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) → binder to hold powders together.  
- Lactose → filler/diluent to add bulk.  

👉 In short: Excipients are the engineered scaffolding around the active drug, ensuring it can be manufactured, stored, and delivered effectively.  

Would you like me to also give you a taxonomy of excipient classes (binders, fillers, disintegrants, coatings, etc.) in the same structured “form” style we built for smartwatch specs — so you can archive and compare them systematically?
