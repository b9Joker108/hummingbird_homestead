### Soluble-Fibre–Dominant Primary Natural Ingredients ###

- Oats (Avena sativa): rich in the viscous β-glucan soluble fibre that forms a gel in the intestine, lowering LDL cholesterol and moderating postprandial blood glucose spikes  

- Barley (Hordeum vulgare): especially hulled barley, high in β-glucan which slows carbohydrate absorption, improves insulin sensitivity, and supports cardiovascular health  

- Psyllium Husk (Plantago ovata): mucilage-rich husks swell into a viscous gel, acting as a bulk-forming laxative and clinically proven to reduce serum cholesterol levels  

- Chia Seeds (Salvia hispanica): contain soluble mucilage fibres that expand on hydration, promoting satiety, feeding gut microbiota, and stabilising blood sugar levels  

- Flaxseeds (Linum usitatissimum): deliver gel-forming soluble fibre that enhances stool bulk and exerts lipid-lowering effects, alongside providing omega-3 fatty acids  

- Navy Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris): approximately 10 g of soluble fibre per ½ cup (cooked), primarily pectins and gums that support colon health and prevent glycaemic surges  

- Kidney Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris): about 9 g of soluble fibre per ½ cup (cooked), aiding cholesterol management and prolonging fullness through gel-forming pectins  

- Black Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris): roughly 6 g of soluble fibre per ½ cup (cooked), their viscous fibres foster healthy gut flora and modulate lipid absorption  

- Carrots (Daucus carota): 1.7 g of soluble fibre (pectin) in a medium carrot; this pectin softens stools, feeds beneficial bacteria, and helps lower blood lipids  

- Brussels Sprouts (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera): ~2 g of soluble fibre per cup (cooked); the mucilaginous fibres assist in cholesterol reduction and support digestive regularity  

- Apples (Malus domestica): about 1.5 g of pectin-based soluble fibre in a medium apple; acts as a prebiotic, lowers LDL cholesterol, and slows glucose uptake  

- Oranges (Citrus sinensis): ~2 g of pectin per medium fruit; their soluble fibres gel in the gut to improve lipid profiles and nourish colonocytes  

- Pears (Pyrus communis): roughly 2.2 g of pectin in a medium pear; these soluble fibres enhance satiety, moderate glycaemic response, and support gut fermentation
