### Rice, Chinese Black 'Forbidden' ###

**Cooking Time for Chinese Black “Forbidden” Rice**

**Stovetop Absorption Method**
When cooked like standard rice, bring rinsed forbidden rice and two (2) parts water to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer: the grains usually take 30–35 minutes to become tender. After cooking, let it rest covered off the heat for 5–10 minutes before fluffing.

**Stovetop Pasta Method**
In this approach, treat the rice like pasta: use a large pot of boiling water [about six (6) cups per one (1) cup rice], simmer uncovered and drain when tender. Expect 25–40 minutes of simmering, depending on your texture preference.

**Instant Pot (Pressure Cooker)**
For a hands-off method, use a one (1) cup rice: 1¾ cups water ratio. Cook on high pressure for eighteen (18) minutes, then allow a natural release for at least ten (10) minutes. This yields perfectly chewy grains with minimal babysitting.

**Rice Cooker**
If you prefer set-and-forget, a rice cooker run takes circa 60 minutes to fully cook forbidden rice: roughly twice as long as brown rice in the same device.

**Tip on Soaking**
Soaking four (4) – six (6) hours (or overnight) isn’t strictly required but can tenderize the grains and shave a few minutes off stovetop cooking. If you soak, simply drain and proceed with the same cooking times above.

**Flavor Variations**  
- Swap water for broth in the absorption or pilaf methods for extra depth.  
- Toast rice briefly in oil and/or ghee with aromatics (onion, garlic, herbs, spices) before adding liquid for a fragrant pilaf.
