🧑‍🍳 What Is Velouté?
Velouté (from velour, meaning “velvety”) is a classic French sauce made by thickening stock with a roux—a cooked mixture of butter and flour. In this recipe, it’s enriched with white wine, cream, Dijon mustard, and tarragon to create a tangy, aromatic gravy that pairs beautifully with poultry.

- Dijon: A style of mustard from Dijon, Burgundy—smooth, sharp, and essential.  
- Sauter: To pan-sear or “jump” the meat in hot fat.  
- Monter au beurre: To finish a sauce with butter for richness and sheen.  
- Déglacer: To deglaze the pan with wine, lifting flavorful bits into the sauce.
