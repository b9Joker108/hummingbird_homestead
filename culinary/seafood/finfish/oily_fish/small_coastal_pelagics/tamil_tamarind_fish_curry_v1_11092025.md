# Tamarind Fish Curry #

A traditional accompaniment with Neeragaram (or Pazhayathu): a fermented rice water dish of Tamil Nadu, traditionally eaten in the morning with raw onions, green chillies and sometimes pickles or dry fish. But when paired with fish curry, the ideal match is something tangy, rustic, and tamarind-forward, often made the day before so its flavours deepen overnight — just like the rice.

🐟 Traditional Fish Curry for One (Tamil Nadu Style)

🍛 Name: Meen Kuzhambu (மீன் குழம்பு) — Tamarind Fish Curry

This is the classic pairing with Neeragaram, especially in rural Tamil households. It’s:

- Tamarind-based: sour and earthy, balancing the fermented rice
- Spiced but not creamy: no coconut or dairy, just roasted spices and shallots
- Made with small fish: sardines, mackerel, or anchovies (nethili meen) are traditional
- Best aged: improves after resting overnight, making it perfect for solo batch logic
