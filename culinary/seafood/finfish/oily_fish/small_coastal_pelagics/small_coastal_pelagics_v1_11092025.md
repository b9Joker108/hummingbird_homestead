The fish used in Meen Kuzhambu (Tamil-style tamarind fish curry) typically belong to the culinary taxonomy of small, oily, coastal fish, prized for their umami depth, bone-in texture, and ability to hold flavour in acidic gravies. Here's a breakdown:

🐟 Culinary Taxonomy of Traditional Fish Types

| Common Name | Culinary Type | Taxonomic Family | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Sardine (Mathi Meen) | Small oily fish | Clupeidae | Rich in omega-3, holds up well in tamarind gravies  
| Anchovy (Nethili Meen) | Tiny oily fish | Engraulidae | Often dried or fresh; intense flavor, quick cooking  
| Mackerel (Ayala Meen) | Medium oily fish | Scombridae | Firm flesh, ideal for sour curries  
| Tilapia (Jalebi Meen) | Mild freshwater fish | Cichlidae | Less traditional, but used in modern adaptations  
| Catfish (Keluthi Meen) | Muddy freshwater fish | Siluridae | Used in rural variants; earthy flavor

🧠 Culinary Type: “Oily Coastal Fish”

- Flavour Profile: Bold, briny, and umami-rich — ideal for sour and spicy gravies
- Cooking Behaviour: Holds shape in simmering tamarind broth; bones soften slightly
- Traditional Use: Often used whole or bone-in, enhancing the broth’s depth

These fish are chosen not just for availability, but for their culinary synergy with tamarind, fenugreek, and sesame oil — the holy trinity of Tamil fish gravies.

🛒 Where to Source

- Queen Victoria Market: Fresh sardines, mackerel, trevally, and scad often available
- Dandenong Market: Excellent for South Asian fish varieties, including frozen Indian mackerel and anchovies
- Sri Lankan and Indian grocers: Often stock frozen nethili, ayala, and even dried fish for traditional gravies

🧠 Cooking Logic

- Choose bone-in, skin-on fish for depth of flavor
- Avoid fillets unless you’re adapting for texture or dietary needs
- If using frozen fish, thaw gently and pat dry before adding to curry

Great framing, Beauford. The simplest culinary taxonomy that binds sardines, anchovies, mackerel, trevally, and scad — especially in the context of Meen Kuzhambu and similar gravies — would be:

> Finfish / Oily Fish / Small Coastal Pelagics

Here’s how that breaks down:

---

🧬 Simple Culinary Taxonomy

| Level | Category | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Finfish | Vertebrate fish with fins (as opposed to shellfish)  
| 2 | Oily Fish | High in omega-3s; store fat in muscle tissue  
| 3 | Small Coastal Pelagics | Live in nearshore waters; often migratory and schooling  
| 4 | Clupeiformes / Scombriformes / Carangiformes | Taxonomic orders covering sardines, mackerel, scad, trevally

🧠 Why This Taxonomy Works

- Culinary logic: These fish are chosen for their bold flavor, bone-in texture, and ability to hold up in acidic gravies
- Health logic: Rich in omega-3s, low in mercury, and ideal for metabolic support (e.g. fatty liver management)
- Cultural logic: Used in traditional Tamil, Malay, and Sri Lankan gravies — often whole, skin-on, and simmered in tamarind
