# Scottish Kippers #


So, where do we put Scottish kippers in the taxonomy?

## Taxonomic Placement of Scottish Kippers

### 1. Biological Classification

**Scottish kippers** are not a species, but a traditional preparation of **Atlantic herring** (*Clupea harengus*):

- **Kingdom:** Animalia
- **Phylum:** Chordata
- **Class:** Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes)
- **Order:** Clupeiformes
- **Family:** Clupeidae
- **Genus:** Clupea
- **Species:** *Clupea harengus* (Atlantic herring)[1][2][9]

### 2. Culinary and Seafood Taxonomy

Within a culinary seafood taxonomy (for reference books or cookbooks), **Scottish kippers** are best placed as follows:

| Major Category | Subcategory              | Specific Item         | Preparation Type              |
|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Finfish        | Oily, Marine (Pelagic)  | Herring (*Clupea harengus*) | Split, salted, cold-smoked “kipper” [2][3][6] |

#### Definition

- **Scottish kipper:** A cold-smoked, split Atlantic herring. The process involves removing guts and gills, splitting the fish “butterfly” style, quick salting or brining, and then cold-smoking[2][3]. Scottish kippers are a “processed fish product,” but remain biologically and nutritionally herring[2].

### 4. Placement Example in a Cookbook Index

| Seafood Category | Example Entries                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Finfish          | Herring (fresh, salted, smoked, kippered)   |
| Oily Fish        | Mackerel, sardine, herring, kipper          |
| Prepared & Smoked| Kipper (cold-smoked herring), smoked salmon |

### 5. Dietary Notation

- **Pescatarian:** Yes (contains fish only)
- **Vegetarian/Vegan:** No
- **Allergen:** Fish

**Summary:**  
Scottish kippers belong under **Finfish** → **Oily Fish** → **Herring** (prepared as cold-smoked “kipper”). In culinary and dietary taxonomies, always list them as a *form of herring* (Clupeidae family) and as a *smoked fish product*, distinct from shellfish and other seafood categories[1][2][3][6].
