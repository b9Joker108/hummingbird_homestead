# Whitefish Introduction #

## Haddock)
Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) is not native to Australia and is primarily imported from the North Atlantic. In Australia, consumers can find haddock, particularly smoked haddock, in fresh and frozen forms at premium supermarkets, specialty fish markets and online retailers, often used in dishes like kedgeree or fish pies. Whilst haddock is not a local fish, its flavour and texture are sometimes approximated by Australian fish like hoki, pollock and blue cod (Hyperoglyphe antarctica) (or even flathead or ling), though these are distinct species.  

Hyperoglyphe antarctica (blue-eye trevalla) can work as a haddock stand-in in your Melbourne-style Fish Pie—but you’ll need to tweak a few things to account for its texture and flavor profile.

1. Flesh & Flavor Profile  
   - Blue-eye trevalla fillets are firm, dense, and hold together beautifully when poached or baked.  
   - They have a mild, slightly sweet “white-fish” taste, though less delicate than haddock’s.  
   - Because it’s a deep-water species, it can be a bit more “meaty” and less flaky than cod or haddock.

2. Cooking Adjustments  
   - Cut trevalla into smaller, bite-sized pieces (8–10 mm cubes) so they poach through at the same rate as your other fish.  
   - Shorten poaching time by 1–2 minutes: its firm flesh takes longer to absorb liquid, but over-simmering can lead to a rubbery texture.  
   - If you’re using a mixed white-fish base (e.g. a blend of trevalla plus a softer fillet like hoki or pollock), trevalla’s firmness helps prevent your pie filling from turning mushy.

3. Salt & Moisture  
   - Trevalla tends to retain moisture, so reduce added salt in your poaching liquor by about 10–15 % to avoid an overly briny sauce.  
   - Ensure you strain and reserve your poach liquor carefully—it carries less “fishy” oils than haddock, so your béchamel may need an extra splash of cream or butter for richness.

4. Availability & Sustainability in Melbourne  
   - Blue-eye trevalla is widely available in Melbourne fishmongers under names like “trevalla” or “bluenose.”  
   - It’s considered a relatively sustainable deep-water catch when sourced from responsibly managed stocks around Tasmania and the Southern Ocean.

|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Texture                | Firm, holds shape well in stews and pies               | Less delicate/flaky than haddock or cod              |
| Flavor                 | Mild, slightly sweet                                   | Lacks the classic “smoky” edge of smoked haddock     |
| Cook time              | Stable under heat                                      | Requires careful poaching to avoid rubberiness       |
| Local availability     | Good in Melbourne; often mid-price                     | Can be pricier than pollock or hoki                  |
| Sustainability         | Generally well-managed Southern Ocean fishery          | Deep-water fisheries can have higher carbon footprint|

Bottom line: If you’re comfortable offsetting its firm texture with shorter poach times and a small blend of softer white fish, Hyperoglyphe antarctica makes a perfectly serviceable—and locally sovereign—alternative to haddock in your solo-serve Fish Pie.

Flounder and Flathead both make serviceable white-fish options in your solo-serve Fish Pie—here’s how they compare to haddock and how to handle each.  

---

Flounder (and its cousins, sole)
- Flavor & Texture  
  • Delicate, mildly sweet, very fine-flaked flesh that mirrors haddock’s clean profile.  
  • cooks through quickly and can fall apart if overhandled.  

- Cooking Adjustments  
  • Cut into bite-sized pieces (8–10 mm) to match poach times with any heartier fish in the mix.  
  • Poach gently at a bare simmer for 4–5 minutes—any longer and you risk a mushy filling.  
  • Strain poaching liquor carefully; ﬂounder releases less oil than haddock, so you may want to enrich your béchamel with an extra 10–15 mL cream or a knob of butter.  

- Suitability in Fish Pie  
  • Ideal if you want a very tender, “nursery food” style pie without strong fishy notes.  
  • Best paired with a small amount of a firmer white fish (e.g., pollock or trevalla) to give the filling structure.

Australian Flathead (Platycephalus spp.)
- Flavour & Texture  
  • Firm, slightly sweet flesh that holds its shape under poaching and baking.  
  • Less flaky than haddock but not as dense as trevalla—gives a nice bite in each spoonful.  

- Cooking Adjustments  
  • Cube to 10 mm pieces and poach at a gentle simmer for 5–6 minutes.  
  • Because flathead retains moisture well, reduce added salt in your poaching liquid by ~10 % to prevent a briny sauce.  
  • If used alone, consider stirring in 1 Tbsp crème fraîche or extra cream at the finish to lend richness.  

- Suitability in Fish Pie  
  • Excellent for a more textural filling, especially if you enjoy identifiable fish chunks.  
  • Pairs beautifully with small prawns or salmon flake for color contrast and mouthfeel.

Bottom line:  
• Choose flounder when you want the lightest, whitest filling and a mash-forward “comfort” pie.  
• Opt for flathead if you prefer a firmer bite and don’t mind a slightly sweeter, chunkier texture. Both will honour the spirit of a British Fish Pie while playing to local Melbourne sourcing and seasonality.
