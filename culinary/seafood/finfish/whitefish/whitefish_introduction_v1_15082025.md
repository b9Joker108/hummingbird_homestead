## Haddock)
Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) is not native to Australia and is primarily imported from the North Atlantic. In Australia, consumers can find haddock, particularly smoked haddock, in fresh and frozen forms at premium supermarkets, specialty fish markets and online retailers, often used in dishes like kedgeree or fish pies. Whilst haddock is not a local fish, its flavour and texture are sometimes approximated by Australian fish like hoki and blue cod (or even flathead or ling), though these are distinct species.
