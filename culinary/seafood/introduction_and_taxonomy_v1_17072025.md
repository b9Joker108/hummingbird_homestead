Just focus on seafood taxonomy for my book. That is complex enough.

## Seafood Taxonomy for Culinary Reference

A clear, logical seafood taxonomy allows readers to accurately identify, choose, and cook marine and freshwater foods according to their dietary and culinary needs. Below is a system suitable for a cookbook, designed for clarity and consistency, and reflecting both traditional usage and global seafood diversity.

### 1. Major Categories of Seafood

Seafood is a broad term, best structured along biological and culinary lines:

- **Finfish (true fish, vertebrates with fins and gills)**
- **Shellfish (invertebrate seafood, including crustaceans and molluscs)**
- **Other Marine Foods** (non-fish, non-shellfish edibles such as sea vegetables, echinoderms)

### 2. Finfish

**A. Classification by Habitat**

| Group                | Characteristics/Examples            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Saltwater (Marine)   | Cod, haddock, snapper, salmon (sea run), sardines, tuna |
| Freshwater           | Trout, perch, catfish, Murray cod   |
| Anadromous           | Spend life in both salt and fresh water (e.g., salmon, eel) |

**B. Classification by Fat Content and Texture**

| Type            | Qualities/Examples                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| White, Lean     | Cod, flathead, whiting, bream       |
| Oily, Rich      | Salmon, mackerel, sardine, herring  |
| Firm-fleshed    | Swordfish, barramundi, blue-eye trevalla |
| Delicate        | Flounder, John Dory, sole           |

### 3. Shellfish

**A. Crustaceans**  
Exoskeleton (shell), segmented bodies, jointed appendages.

- **Crab** (e.g., blue swimmer, mud crab, snow crab)
- **Prawn/Shrimp** (e.g., king prawn, tiger prawn)
- **Lobster** (marine, usually clawless e.g., rock lobster)
- **Crayfish/Yabby** (freshwater)
- **More:** Marron, langoustine, Balmain bug

**B. Molluscs**  
Soft-bodied, often inside a shell.

- **Bivalves:**  Two shells; e.g., oyster, mussel, clam, scallop, pipi
- **Gastropods:** Single shell or none; e.g., abalone, whelk, periwinkle
- **Cephalopods:** Reduced or internal shell, muscular arms; e.g., squid (calamari), octopus, cuttlefish

### 4. Other Marine Foods

**A. Echinoderms**  
Radially symmetrical invertebrates:

- **Sea urchins** (roe/uni)
- **Sea cucumbers** (bÃªche-de-mer, trepang in Asian cuisines)

**B. Sea Vegetables**  
Edible algae/seaweed:

- **Kelp, wakame, nori, dulse**â€”used fresh, dried, or reconstituted

**C. Other**  
- **Jellyfish (certain species, prepared for food in Asian cuisine)**
- **Roe** (fish eggs, e.g., salmon roe, flying fish roe, caviar)

### 5. Culinary Cross-References

| Subgroup             | Is a Fish? | Is a Shellfish? | Major Allergens | Notes                  |
|----------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Salmon, cod, trout   | Yes        | No              | Fish            | Finfish                |
| Prawns, lobster      | No         | Yes             | Crustacean      | Shellfish              |
| Oysters, mussels     | No         | Yes             | Mollusc         | Bivalve molluscs       |
| Squid, octopus       | No         | Yes             | Mollusc         | Cephalopods            |
| Seaweed (nori)       | No         | No              | Rare            | Marine vegetable       |
| Roe (caviar/uni)     | No*        | No*             | Fish            | Source species varies  |
| Abalone, whelk       | No         | Yes             | Mollusc         | Gastropod molluscs     |
| Sea cucumber, urchin | No         | No              | Rare            | Echinoderm             |

\*Roe is not itself a fish, but is animal-derived and allergenic for some.

### 6. Key Points for Cookbook Reference

- Always specify the exact type of seafood (common and scientific names, if possible).
- Clearly identify shellfish subtypes (crustacean vs. mollusc vs. cephalopod) for allergy and dietary reasons.
- For each recipe, tag appropriately: e.g., `Finfish`, `Crustacean`, `Bivalve`, `Cephalopod`, `Contains Fish`, `Contains Shellfish`, `Contains Mollusc`.
- Consider adding a simple icon or annotation system for quick visual reference.

### 7. Example Reference Table for Indexing

| Name             | Type         | Subtype         | Source Waters     | Allergen | Recipe Suitability    |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|----------------------|
| Flathead         | Finfish      | White, marine   | Saltwater        | Yes     | Fish, pescatarian    |
| King prawn       | Shellfish    | Crustacean      | Marine/estuarine | Yes     | Shellfish, pescatarian |
| Sydney rock oyster | Shellfish  | Bivalve mollusc | Saltwater        | Yes     | Shellfish, pescatarian |
| Abalone          | Shellfish    | Gastropod mollusc| Marine          | Yes     | Shellfish, pescatarian |
| Kangaroo Island kelp | Other    | Sea vegetable   | Marine           | No      | Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian |
