# Dried Fish #

In traditional Tamil cuisine, dried fish (karuvadu) is a deeply flavorful, umami-rich ingredient used to create robust, rustic gravies — especially in coastal and agrarian households. It’s not a substitute for fresh fish, but a culinary category of its own, prized for its intensity, shelf-stability, and ability to transform simple ingredients into deeply satisfying meals.

🐟 Dried Fish in Tamil Gravies: Culinary Logic

🔥 Why It’s Used
- Preservation: Sun-dried fish was essential before refrigeration, especially in coastal Tamil Nadu
- Flavor Concentration: Drying intensifies umami and salt, making it ideal for bold gravies
- Accessibility: Available year-round, even inland or during monsoon when fresh fish is scarce

🧂 Preparation & Cooking Method

1. Rinse thoroughly: Dried fish is often salty and dusty — soak briefly if needed
2. Dry roast or shallow fry: Enhances aroma and reduces fishiness
3. Add to gravy base: Tamarind, tomato, onion, garlic, and spices
4. Simmer gently: Dried fish rehydrates and infuses the gravy with deep flavor

🧠 Pairing Logic

- Tamarind balances salt and umami
- Fenugreek and mustard seeds temper bitterness
- Sesame oil (gingelly) adds depth and authenticity
- Fermented rice dishes like Neeragaram or Pazhayathu pair beautifully — the lactic tang complements the dried fish’s intensity
