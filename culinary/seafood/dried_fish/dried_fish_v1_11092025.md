# Dried Fish #

In traditional Tamil cuisine, dried fish (karuvadu) is a deeply flavorful, umami-rich ingredient used to create robust, rustic gravies — especially in coastal and agrarian households. It’s not a substitute for fresh fish, but a culinary category of its own, prized for its intensity, shelf-stability, and ability to transform simple ingredients into deeply satisfying meals.

🐟 Dried Fish in Tamil Gravies: Culinary Logic

🔥 Why It’s Used
- Preservation: Sun-dried fish was essential before refrigeration, especially in coastal Tamil Nadu
- Flavor Concentration: Drying intensifies umami and salt, making it ideal for bold gravies
- Accessibility: Available year-round, even inland or during monsoon when fresh fish is scarce

🍛 Common Gravies Featuring Dried Fish

| Dish Name | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Karuvadu Kuzhambu | Tamarind-based dried fish curry | Often made with drumsticks, brinjal, or raw mango  
| Karuvadu Thokku | Thick, spicy sautéed gravy | Uses tomato, onion, and masala; eaten with rice or dosa  
| Karuvadu Vatha Kuzhambu | Sour, peppery gravy with dried fish | Combines dried fish with sun-dried berries (manathakkali)  
| Karuvadu Rasam | Spicy broth with dried fish | Rare but found in coastal homes; medicinal and warming

🧂 Preparation & Cooking Method

1. Rinse thoroughly: Dried fish is often salty and dusty — soak briefly if needed
2. Dry roast or shallow fry: Enhances aroma and reduces fishiness
3. Add to gravy base: Tamarind, tomato, onion, garlic, and spices
4. Simmer gently: Dried fish rehydrates and infuses the gravy with deep flavor

---

🧠 Pairing Logic

- Tamarind balances salt and umami
- Fenugreek and mustard seeds temper bitterness
- Sesame oil (gingelly) adds depth and authenticity
- Fermented rice dishes like Neeragaram or Pazhayathu pair beautifully — the lactic tang complements the dried fish’s intensity

🧼 Prep & Storage Tips

- Rinse well: Soak briefly in warm water to remove excess salt and dust
- Dry roast or shallow fry: Enhances aroma and reduces fishiness
- Store in airtight jars: Keep in cool, dry place or refrigerate for longer shelf life
- Use sparingly: A little goes a long way in gravies — 20–30 g is often enough for solo batches

---

🧠 Health Note (Fatty Liver Context)

- Dried fish is high in protein and minerals, but also high in sodium
- Use in moderation, pair with potassium-rich vegetables (e.g. drumstick, brinjal) and fermented rice (Neeragaram) to balance
- Avoid deep-frying; prefer shallow sauté or simmering in tamarind broth
