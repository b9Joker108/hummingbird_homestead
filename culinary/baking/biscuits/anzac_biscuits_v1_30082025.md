🥥 Coconut Flour ANZAC Biscuits (Small Batch)
Gluten-light, golden, and steeped in tradition

📋 Ingredients:
* 60g unsalted butter  
* 1 tbsp golden syrup (or maple syrup if needed)  
* 2 tbsp coconut flour  
* ½ tsp baking soda  
* ⅓ cup brown sugar (firmly packed)  
* ½ cup rolled oats  
* 1 tbsp milk or water (to balance coconut flour’s absorbency)  
* Optional: 1 tbsp desiccated coconut for extra texture

🔧 Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (fan-forced) or 190°C (conventional). Line a baking tray with parchment paper.

2. In a small saucepan (or microwave-safe bowl), melt the butter gently. Stir in the golden syrup until smooth and glossy.

3. In a mixing bowl, combine coconut flour, baking soda, brown sugar, oats, and optional desiccated coconut.

4. Pour the warm butter-syrup mixture into the dry ingredients. Add 1 tbsp milk or water and stir until evenly combined. Note: The dough should be moist but not sticky. If it feels dry or crumbly, add a splash more liquid.

5. Roll into balls (~3cm diameter), place on tray, and gently flatten with your fingers or a fork.

6. Bake for 8–10 minutes (fan-forced) or 10–12 minutes (conventional), until edges are golden and centers are just set.

7. Let cool on tray for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to crisp up.

❄️ Freezing Tips:

To freeze the dough:  
* Roll into balls and place on a tray to freeze until firm. Then transfer to a ziplock bag or airtight container. 
  → Freeze for up to 2 months.

To bake from frozen:  
* Bake directly from frozen at 180°C, adding 1–2 minutes to the baking time.
* Flatten slightly before baking if needed.

**Use baking soda, not baking powder!**

In classic ANZAC biscuit recipes, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is used because it reacts with the acidic golden syrup to create a gentle rise and that signature chewy texture. Baking powder, being a mix of acid and base, doesn’t interact the same way and would yield a puffier, less traditional result.

So yes: use baking soda. Just ½ teaspoon is enough for this small batch to do its alchemical work.

If you’re experimenting with coconut flour and want a slightly airier texture, I can suggest a hybrid leavening tweak—but only if you’re game for a deviation from tradition.

BTW, a hybrid leavening tweak refers to using both baking soda and baking powder: each contributing different effects to the biscuit’s texture and rise.

Here’s the logic:

* Baking soda reacts with acidic ingredients (like golden syrup) to create a chewy texture and subtle spread.
* Baking powder contains both acid and base, so it activates on its own and gives a bit more lift—resulting in a slightly puffier, lighter crumb.

In coconut flour ANZAC biscuits, where the dough can be dense and absorbent, a hybrid tweak can help counteract that heaviness without straying too far from tradition.

🧪 Suggested tweak:
- Use ¼ tsp baking soda + ¼ tsp baking powder instead of ½ tsp baking soda.

This gives you:
- A touch more loft
- Slightly softer centers
- Better structure if freezing the dough
