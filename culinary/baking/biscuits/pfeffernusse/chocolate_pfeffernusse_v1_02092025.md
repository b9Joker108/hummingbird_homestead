# Chocolate Pfeffernüsse with Lemon Glaze (German: Schokoladen-Pfeffernüsse mit Zitronenguss)

These chocolate gingerbread biscuits are incredibly soft, spiced, and aromatic! The sugar glaze perfectly complements them. Easy to prepare and are completely without raw egg! Perfect for Winter or simply as a little treat in between.  

[![Watch on YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/g-mRaYQThUo/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/g-mRaYQThUo)


### Ingredients for Soft Chocolate Gingerbread with Glaze: ###
* 200 ml milk  
* 220 g sugar  
* 100 g flour (for the first step)  
* 1/3 tsp salt  
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon  
* 1/3 tsp nutmeg  
* 1/3 tsp ginger  
* 40 ml vegetable oil  
* 40 g dark chocolate (melted)  
* 30 g cocoa powder  
* 220–250 g flour (for the dough)  
* 12 g baking powder  

For the glaze:  
* 130 g icing sugar  
* 5 tsp water  
* 3 tsp lemon juice  



Quick verdict

What you’ve written matches a “soft chocolate gingerbread cookie with lemon glaze” workflow, not a traditional Pfeffernüsse. It likely accords if the video shows a milk-scalded paste, oil + melted chocolate, cocoa, and baking powder, with a simple lemon icing. It diverges from classic Pfeffernüsse in four ways: no honey/treacle, no baker’s ammonia, no black pepper, and no dough-aging. If the video is indeed titled as a lost gingerbread (Lebkuchen) recipe, your method fits that style more than Pfeffernüsse.

---

Specific alignment vs. the video style

- Ingredients and mixing:
  - Hot milk into sugar + a small initial flour portion, then cool, then add cocoa, oil, melted dark chocolate, more flour, baking powder, and ground spices: consistent with quick, tender gingerbread cookies.
  - Spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger) and lemon icing: consistent with gingerbread; absence of pepper is atypical for Pfeffernüsse.
- Texture/process:
  - Sticky dough, rolled to 1 cm and cut to 3 cm rounds: plausible. Many such cookies are scooped rather than rolled, but cut rounds are fine.
  - Bake 180°C, 10–12 minutes, no fan: standard.
  - Glaze: 130 g icing sugar + ~5 tsp water + 3 tsp lemon juice, dry 4–6 hours or overnight: standard.

Where it departs from Pfeffernüsse:
- No honey/treacle and no ammonium carbonate (baker’s ammonia).
- No black pepper.
- No overnight rest to mature the dough and spices (you do rest the glaze, not the dough).

If your intention is Pfeffernüsse, consider adding black pepper, swapping part of the sugar for honey/treacle, using baker’s ammonia, and giving the dough a chill/rest. If you’re faithfully capturing the video, the current write-up is accurate for “soft chocolate gingerbread” cookies.

Tighten your method with precise quantities you gave

- Milk: 200 ml hot
- Sugar: 220 g (initial mix)
- Flour: 100 g (initial) + 220–250 g later
- Cocoa powder: 30 g
- Dark chocolate: 40 g, melted
- Vegetable oil: 40 ml
- Baking powder: 12 g
- Salt: 1/3 tsp
- Cinnamon: 1/2 tsp
- Nutmeg: 1/3 tsp
- Ginger: 1/3 tsp
- Icing sugar for glaze: 130 g
- Water: 5 tsp
- Lemon juice: 3 tsp

Suggested small refinements:
- Bloom cocoa: sift cocoa with the later flour; keep melted chocolate separate.
- Temperature note: “180°C conventional, no fan” as you stated.
- Doneness cue: fine cracks on the surface, edges set, centers soft.

---

If you want it to read as Pfeffernüsse

- Add 0.5–1.0 g very fine black pepper.
- Replace 80–120 g of the 220 g sugar with honey or treacle; warm honey with milk before mixing.
- Swap 5–7 g of baking powder for 5 g baker’s ammonia (ventilate during baking).
- Chill dough 2–12 hours for spice bloom; then scoop into balls (20–25 g) rather than rolling/cutting for the classic look.

If you want me to lock it to “Pfeffernüsse,” I can provide the exact swaps and update the title, tags, and technique cues accordingly.


### Intended outcomes of the “elevation”

* Texture (shell/crumb): Baker’s ammonia creates a thin, shattery shell with a drier, fine-porous crumb—distinct from the cakier baking-powder version. Expect lighter bite, faster moisture equalization, and classic Pfeffernüsse “snap” that softens by day 2–3.
* Flavor depth: Honey/treacle brings Maillard and mineral bitters that cocoa alone can’t. Black pepper adds a clean, warming “lift” that sharpens the spice chord rather than reading as “heat.”
* Aroma maturity: Overnight rest blooms volatile spice compounds and integrates fat/sugar phases. The result is rounder spice, less “raw cocoa,” and a unified Lebkuchen profile.
* Visuals and form: Scooped balls produce domed tops with micro-cracks typical of Pfeffernüsse; rolled/cut rounds look flatter and more “gingerbread cookie.”
* Glaze performance: Crisp shell + slight surface porosity gives better glaze cling and even sheen; drying is more uniform, fewer “bald” patches.
* Shelf life and day-2 improvement: Reduced water activity from honey + ammonia leavening helps the cookies keep their character longer, with peak eating on days 2–3.

If you want, I can give side-by-side parameters (mass loss %, dome height, glaze dry time) so you can audit these outcomes batch-to-batch.

That’s the heart of it. Let’s engineer that thin, shattery shell on purpose.

* Leavener swap: Use baker’s ammonia (ammonium carbonate) at 0.5–0.8% of total flour mass.
  - For 320–350 g flour: 1.6–2.8 g baker’s ammonia. Ventilate; the smell bakes off.
* Dough hydration: Keep dough on the stiff side so the surface dries fast.
  - Target “just scoopable,” not smearable. If sticky, add 10–20 g flour, not liquid.
* Portioning geometry: Scoop into 20–25 g balls; don’t flatten.
  - Domes promote micro-cracks and a glassy crust; cut rounds stay cakier.
* Surface drying: Air-dry scooped balls 10–15 minutes before baking.
  - A slightly tack-free skin helps the shell set and fracture.
* Bake profile: 180°C conventional, center rack, 10–12 minutes.
  - Look for fine cracks and matte tops; pull while centers are still tender.
* Sugar choice: Replace 80–120 g of sugar with honey or treacle for better crust and day-2 bloom.
* Spice lift: Add 0.5–1.0 g very fine black pepper; it sharpens without “heat.”
* Rest for maturity: Chill dough 2–12 hours. Spices round out; shell forms cleaner.
* Glaze timing: Cool completely, then dip in a thick ribboning glaze; dry 4–6 hours.
  - Crisp shell + slight porosity = even, shimmery coat.

If you share your flour mass and current leavener amount, I’ll compute the exact baker’s ammonia dose and adjust bake time for your oven.
