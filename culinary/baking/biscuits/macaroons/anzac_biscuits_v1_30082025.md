🥥 Coconut Flour ANZAC Biscuits (Small Batch)
Gluten-light, golden, and steeped in tradition

📋 Ingredients:
- 60g unsalted butter  
- 1 tbsp golden syrup (or maple syrup if needed)  
- 2 tbsp coconut flour  
- ½ tsp baking soda  
- ⅓ cup brown sugar (firmly packed)  
- ½ cup rolled oats  
- 1 tbsp milk or water (to balance coconut flour’s absorbency)  
- Optional: 1 tbsp desiccated coconut for extra texture

🔧 Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (fan-forced) or 190°C (conventional). Line a baking tray with parchment paper.

2. In a small saucepan (or microwave-safe bowl), melt the butter gently. Stir in the golden syrup until smooth and glossy.

3. In a mixing bowl, combine coconut flour, baking soda, brown sugar, oats, and optional desiccated coconut.

4. Pour the warm butter-syrup mixture into the dry ingredients. Add 1 tbsp milk or water and stir until evenly combined.  
   - The dough should be moist but not sticky. If it feels dry or crumbly, add a splash more liquid.

5. Roll into balls (~3cm diameter), place on tray, and gently flatten with your fingers or a fork.

6. Bake for 8–10 minutes (fan-forced) or 10–12 minutes (conventional), until edges are golden and centers are just set.

7. Let cool on tray for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to crisp up.

❄️ Freezing Tips:

- To freeze the dough:  
  Roll into balls and place on a tray to freeze until firm. Then transfer to a ziplock bag or airtight container.  
  → Freeze for up to 2 months.

- To bake from frozen:  
  Bake directly from frozen at 180°C, adding 1–2 minutes to the baking time. Flatten slightly before baking if needed.

Would you like a version that’s fully gluten-free (subbing oats too), or perhaps one with native Australian ingredients like wattleseed or macadamia? I’d be delighted to riff on the theme.
