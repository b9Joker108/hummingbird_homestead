# Ful Medames #

**So, Ful Medames, was traditionally made of Faba beans, pre-soaked overnight, then the beans with skin were simmered over the next night and eaten for breakfast?**

Yes — that’s the traditional rhythm of ful medames in its classic Egyptian form, especially in communal or street-vendor contexts.

⏳ Traditional workflow (pre-industrial, Cairo-style)

1. Dried whole [faba beans](https://github.com/b9Joker108/hummingbird_homestead/blob/main/apothecary/pantry/pulses/beans/faba_fava_broadbean_v1_20092025.md) (often horse beans, small and sturdy) were:
   - Soaked overnight to soften and begin hydration.
   - Unpeeled — skins left on, partly for structure and partly due to labor/time constraints.

2. Simmered slowly overnight:
   - In large clay or metal cauldrons, often over embers or low fire.
   - Sometimes with lentils, wheat, or rice added for starch and flavor.
   - No salt early on — just water and maybe a bay leaf or garlic clove.

3. Served at dawn:
   - Beans ladled out warm, often mashed slightly.
   - Finished with lemon juice, cumin, olive oil, chili, and sometimes tahini or boiled egg.
   - Eaten with flatbread (baladi) — a sustaining breakfast for laborers, students, and families.

🧂 Skin-on tradition: why it persisted

- Labour-saving: Peeling hundreds of beans was impractical for large batches.
- Texture: Skins gave body and rustic chew — diners could discard them manually if desired.
- Flavour: Some bitterness was culturally accepted, even desired.
- Digestibility: Less emphasized historically; modern solo cooks often peel for comfort and finesse.

🏺 Vessel lore

- Traditional ful pots were tall, narrow, and heavy-bottomed — designed to retain heat and minimize evaporation. Some were buried in embers or kept in communal ovens overnight.

For your solo homesteading adaptation, I’d recommend:
- Using split peeled favas for speed and smoothness.
- Or, if using whole dried favas, soak and peel post-cook for digestibility.
- Simmer in a small clay or enamel pot for 1–2 portions.
- Finish with your preferred acid-fat-spice trio.
