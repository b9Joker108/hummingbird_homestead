In my apothecary taxonomy and ontology, wortcunning is going to be subsumed, this is plantlore and phyto-medicine with its most expansive domain and purview. As you did for Apothecary, now do for: Wortcunning, NB: we will generate YAML after.

Certainly—here is an extended, scholarly account of **wortcunning**: its historicity, etymology, polysemies, cultural and linguistic flow, registers, boundaries, and efflorescence, as you valued with “apothecary.” This will lay the groundwork for subsequent YAML formalization.

## Wortcunning: Historicity, Lexicon, Cultural Flow

### Etymology & Deep Linguistic Provenance

- **Old English:**  
  - *wyrt* [IPA: /wurt/]—“plant, herb,” generically any useful or medicinal plant;  
    attested in Beowulf, Anglo-Saxon herbals, and legal texts.
  - *cunnian* [IPA: /ˈkunnian/]—“to know, to test, to try, to be skilled in;”  
    base of Modern English “cunning” (originally “knowledge, expertise,” pejoration to “crafty/guile” much later).
  - *wyrtcunnan*—a compound from Old English, literally “plant-knowing” or “herb-knowledge,” often glossed as “herbal skill, botanical science, or practice of herb-healing.”

- **Middle and Modern English:**  
  - The term persists in dialect as “wortcunning,” “wort-craft,” “wort-lore,” and is revived in folk and esoteric botanical writing from the 19th c. onward.

- **Polysemy and Semantic Expansion:**  
  - “Wortcunning” encompasses (1) practical knowledge of herbs and their habitats; (2) medicinal, ritual, and culinary uses; (3) acts of gathering, preparing, administering;  
    and, in folklore, (4) specific powers of healing, protection, and cunning (the latter crossing over with “cunning folk”—folk healers, see below).

### Registers & Cultural Contexts

| Register          | Term           | Social Sphere           | Meaning/Scope                                               |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| High/Academic     | *herbarium*, *herbarius*, *botanologia* | Monastic, university, elite garden | Literate, systematized herbal lore (often in Latin/Greek)   |
| Learned Vernacular| wortcunning    | Village, rural, oral   | Embodied plant-lore, medicinal practice, folk healing       |
| Magical           | cunning (folk) | Occult, hedgecraft     | Gnosis, ritual curatives, protection, “green magic”         |
| Scientific Modern | ethno-botany / phyto-therapy | University, medical | Study of indigenous and historical plantlore, its uses      |

- **Wortcunner / Wortcunning-woman/man:** Traditionally, the individual—often wise-woman, sometimes wise-man—whose lore, skill, and intuition in plant medicine exceeded the norm; a boundary figure, bridging herbalism, folk magic, domestic healing, and sometimes midwifery.

### Boundaries and Social Functions

- **Within Systematized Medicine:**  
  - Wortcunning may be opposed by or subsume elements of the apothecary, physician, or chemist (notably pre-modern). Marginalized or valorized depending on context.
- **Domestic/Ritual:**  
  - Wortcunning informally inheres in the “stillroom” and “kitchen physic”; often gendered feminine and connected with domestic economy.
- **Magico-Medical Hybrid:**  
  - Many wortcunning practices blend *technic* (physical properties of plants) with *symbolic* (ritual utterance, planetary/astrological timing, sympathetic cures).
- **Transmission:**  
  - Oral tradition, manuscript herbals, regional “physick books,” apprenticeship, secret lore, folk rhyme and charm.

### Spatio-Temporal and Cultural Flow

- **Roots in Germanic, Celtic, and Mediterranean traditions;**  
  transmuted by Christian monastic botanics, Arab and Greco-Roman materia medica, and—later—early-modern herbals (Gerard, Culpeper, Le Livre des Simples).
- **Medieval England:**  
  - Survives in medical charms (e.g., *Lacnunga*, *Leechbook*), manorial garden texts, and ecclesiastical herbals.
- **Early Modern:**  
  - Blended with cunning-craft (wise-craft), potentially suspicious under witch-law but often tolerated as “good” folk practice.
- **Modern Revivals:**  
  - Neoherbalism, folk herbal, “green witchcraft,” plant shamanism—all revalorize wortcunning as ecological healing and ancestral wisdom.

### Symbolic and Social Efflorescence

- **Wortcunning = Embodied Knowledge:**  
  Not just taxonomy, but touch, taste, smell, intuition; the seasonal round, sacred plants, vernacular medicine. 
- **Cultural Tropes:**  
  - “Old woman in the hedge,” “herb-witch,” “hedge-healer,” “green man/lady,” “walking phramacopoeia.”
- **Genres:**  
  - Charms, receipts, “simpling” (gathering), “wort-binding” (making herbal charms or knots), garden orders, incantatory “nine-herb” or “thirteen-herb” rites.

### Key Attestations: Recipes and Practices

- *Old English Nine-Herbs Charm (Lacnunga)*—ritual use of mugwort (*Artemisia vulgaris*, OE *mucgwyrt*) and eight others; magical and medicinal application.
- *Leechbook of Bald* (10th c.)—wort lists, diagnosis, and use of chants.
- *Culpeper’s Complete Herbal* (1653)—bridges folk and learned usages.
- *Modern*: Folk herbalists’ handbooks; oral and community transmission, e.g., Appalachian “root doctors,” British rural “wortcunners,” Australian bush medics.

### Boundaries with Other Ontologies

- Fully subsumes or overlaps with:  
  - Herbalism, folk medicine, cunning-craft, traditional ecologies, domestic pharmacy.
- Distinct from but contiguous with:
  - Apothecary (systematized urban compounding/dispensing)
  - Modern pharmacology (laboratory, chemical compounds)
- In its fullest ambition—encompasses materia medica, but also living landscape, place-lore, planetary and animal correspondences.

### Summary Table: Lexeme, Register, Polysemy

| Lexeme           | Language | Script | Usual Register | Pronunciation | Core Meaning          | Semantic Shift           |
|------------------|----------|--------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| wortcunning      | en       | Latin  | Folk           | /ˈwɜːtˌkʌnɪŋ/ | plantlore, herbal skill | expertise>magic>niche   |
| wyrt             | en (OE)  | Runic  | Lay            | /wurt/        | herb, plant, root     | specific>generic        |
| cunnian         | en (OE)  | Runic  | Lay            | /ˈkunnian/    | to know by experience | knowledge>guile(fq)     |
| wort-cunner      | en       | Latin  | Folk, magico-medical | —        | practitioner         | wise-person>herb-healer |

Wortcunning thus signifies not only technical mastery of medicinal plants, but embeddedness in landscape, custom, and ritual—the living armature of folk, rural, and ritual healing traditions. It was (and remains) both a way of knowing and a way of being in the more-than-human world.
