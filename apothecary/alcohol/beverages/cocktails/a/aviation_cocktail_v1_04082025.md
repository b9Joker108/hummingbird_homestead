# The Aviation Cocktail: History, Recipe and Evolution #

### Origins and Historical Context

The **Aviation cocktail** is a classic, visually striking drink with a sky-blue or lavender hue, created in the early 20th century—a time when aviation was new, glamorous, and awe-inspiring. The drink is widely credited to **Hugo Ensslin**, head bartender at New York City’s Hotel Wallick, who first published the recipe in his 1916 book *Recipes for Mixed Drinks*. The name "Aviation" is a tribute both to the new era of flight and to the cocktail's distinctive color, which evokes the sky[1][2][3][4][5][6].

During the 1920s, the Aviation was popular in American bars, but with the onset of Prohibition and the disappearance of key ingredients (notably crème de violette), it became a rare find. By 1930, Harry Craddock's *The Savoy Cocktail Book* printed a version omitting crème de violette, resulting in a clear or pale yellow drink lacking its signature floral complexity[7][8][4][9].

### The Classic Recipe

**Original 1916 Aviation (Hugo Ensslin):**
- Gin (typically London dry style)
- Fresh lemon juice
- Maraschino liqueur
- Crème de violette (French violet liqueur)

**Standard Proportions Used Today** (for one serving):
- 50ml (2 oz) gin
- 20–22ml (0.75 oz) fresh lemon juice
- 10–15ml (0.5 oz) maraschino liqueur
- 5–7ml (0.25 oz) crème de violette

**Preparation:**
1. Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice.
2. Shake vigorously.
3. Fine strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass.
4. Garnish with a maraschino cherry.

When prepared with crème de violette, the Aviation yields a delicate, floral, and faintly sweet taste with a beautifully colored, sky-blue or lavender hue—hence the name[1][10][8][4][11].

### Key Ingredients and Their Roles

- **Gin:** Provides a botanical and slightly juniper backbone.
- **Lemon juice:** Delivers tartness and balance.
- **Maraschino liqueur:** Sweet with subtle cherry and almond notes; essential for depth.
- **Crème de violette:** Adds floral aroma and the distinct blue tint; its absence turns the drink clear and less floral.

### Variations and Substitutions

- **No Crème de Violette:** During most of the 20th century, crème de violette was unavailable, so many recipes omitted it. This created a tart, clear gin sour.
- **Blue Moon:** Omits maraschino, relying on gin, lemon, and crème de violette alone.
- **Moonlight/Moonshine:** Uses lime juice or Cointreau instead of lemon and maraschino for a citrus-focused profile.
- **Chelsea Aviation:** Adjusts the proportions or adds honey syrup[12][7][13].

### Resurgence

Crème de violette became widely available again in the 2000s, leading to a renaissance for the Aviation, now found at most craft cocktail bars. Bartenders emphasize restraint with the floral liqueur, as excessive amounts can overpower the drink[7][9][10].

### Cultural Significance

- Associated with the glamour of the early aviation era and Prohibition speakeasies[4][6].
- Featured in films and TV shows, symbolizing vintage sophistication[1].
