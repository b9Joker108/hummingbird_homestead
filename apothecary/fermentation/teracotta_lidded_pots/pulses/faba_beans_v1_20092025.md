# Faba Bean Batch #

Micro-batch Short Ferment: Quick Fava Bean Paste for One

Here’s a lean, two-week protocol yielding roughly 250–300 g of tangy, savory fava paste—perfect for daily drizzles, dressings, or quick stir-ins. Scale ingredients up or down by weight; ferment time stays the same.

Ingredients
- 100 g dried split (peeled) fava beans  
- 1 g fine sea salt (≈1 % of bean weight)  
- 2 g coarse sea salt (≈2 % of cooked mash weight, added after cooking)  
- 100 ml filtered water (for cooking)  
- Optional aromatics or spice (e.g., ¼ tsp cumin seeds, 1 garlic clove smashed)

Equipment
- One 250–300 ml unglazed terracotta pot (or 300 ml glass jar with airlock)  
- Small fermentation weight or a sanitized glass pebble  
- Kitchen scale, spoon, thermometer (optional)

Step-by-Step Protocol

1. Soak & Cook  
   - Rinse beans; cover with 3× weight filtered water.  
   - Soak 4–6 hours (shorter soak favors quicker ferment).  
   - Drain; transfer to pot with 100 ml fresh water.  
   - Simmer gently 60 minutes until very soft. Drain, reserve 20 ml cooking liquid.

2. Mash & Salt  
   - While still warm, mash beans to a coarse paste (retain some texture).  
   - Sprinkle in 2 g salt; mix thoroughly.  
   - Taste: should be lightly seasoned—bean flavor still dominant.

3. Pack & Add Starter Salts  
   - Transfer mash to your fermentation vessel.  
   - Press down firmly, eliminating air pockets.  
   - Drizzle reserved cooking liquid over surface to maintain moisture.  
   - Place weight on top, cover with lid or airlock seal.

4. Ferment  
   - Store at 18–22 °C, out of direct sun.  
   - Day 7 check:  
     • Smell—should be pleasantly sour, no sharp ammonia.  
     • If surface looks dry, add a few drops of water.  
   - Day 10–14 taste test:  
     • When acidity is balanced with bean sweetness, stop ferment.  

5. Finish & Store  
   - Remove weight; scrape off any surface film.  
   - Transfer paste to a clean jar; seal and refrigerate.  
   - Keeps 3–4 weeks; flavor deepens over the first week.

Key Notes & Tips

- Salt ratios: Total salt ≈3 % of cooked mash weight ensures safety and speed.  
- Aromatics: Fold in cumin, garlic, or turmeric at mash stage for extra complexity.  
- Vessel choice: Terracotta moderates moisture exchange; glass keeps you visible to monitor early ferment.  
- Texture variations: Leave mash chunky or blitz smooth with a fork.

Optional Two-week Lacto “Pickled” Fava Variation

- Brine: Dissolve 5 g salt in 100 ml water (5 % brine).  
- Preparation: After cooking and cooling to room temperature, pack whole or halved cooked favas in a jar and pour brine to cover.  
- Spices (optional): 1 clove garlic, 1 tsp crushed red pepper.  
- Ferment: Seal with airlock, ferment 10–12 days at 18 °C.  
- Use: Bright bean salad, mezze, or quick-pickle garnish.
