# Faba Bean Batch #

Micro-batch Short Ferment: Quick Fava Bean Paste for One

Here’s a lean, two-week protocol yielding roughly 250–300 g of tangy, savory fava paste—perfect for daily drizzles, dressings, or quick stir-ins. Scale ingredients up or down by weight; ferment time stays the same.

---

Ingredients
- 100 g dried split (peeled) fava beans  
- 1 g fine sea salt (≈1 % of bean weight)  
- 2 g coarse sea salt (≈2 % of cooked mash weight, added after cooking)  
- 100 ml filtered water (for cooking)  
- Optional aromatics or spice (e.g., ¼ tsp cumin seeds, 1 garlic clove smashed)

---

Equipment
- One 250–300 ml unglazed terracotta pot (or 300 ml glass jar with airlock)  
- Small fermentation weight or a sanitized glass pebble  
- Kitchen scale, spoon, thermometer (optional)  

---

Step-by-Step Protocol

1. Soak & Cook  
   - Rinse beans; cover with 3× weight filtered water.  
   - Soak 4–6 hours (shorter soak favors quicker ferment).  
   - Drain; transfer to pot with 100 ml fresh water.  
   - Simmer gently 60 minutes until very soft. Drain, reserve 20 ml cooking liquid.

2. Mash & Salt  
   - While still warm, mash beans to a coarse paste (retain some texture).  
   - Sprinkle in 2 g salt; mix thoroughly.  
   - Taste: should be lightly seasoned—bean flavor still dominant.

3. Pack & Add Starter Salts  
   - Transfer mash to your fermentation vessel.  
   - Press down firmly, eliminating air pockets.  
   - Drizzle reserved cooking liquid over surface to maintain moisture.  
   - Place weight on top, cover with lid or airlock seal.

4. Ferment  
   - Store at 18–22 °C, out of direct sun.  
   - Day 7 check:  
     • Smell—should be pleasantly sour, no sharp ammonia.  
     • If surface looks dry, add a few drops of water.  
   - Day 10–14 taste test:  
     • When acidity is balanced with bean sweetness, stop ferment.  

5. Finish & Store  
   - Remove weight; scrape off any surface film.  
   - Transfer paste to a clean jar; seal and refrigerate.  
   - Keeps 3–4 weeks; flavor deepens over the first week.

Key Notes & Tips

- Salt ratios: Total salt ≈3 % of cooked mash weight ensures safety and speed.  
- Aromatics: Fold in cumin, garlic, or turmeric at mash stage for extra complexity.  
- Vessel choice: Terracotta moderates moisture exchange; glass keeps you visible to monitor early ferment.  
- Texture variations: Leave mash chunky or blitz smooth with a fork.  

---

Optional Two-week Lacto “Pickled” Fava Variation

- Brine: Dissolve 5 g salt in 100 ml water (5 % brine).  
- Preparation: After cooking and cooling to room temperature, pack whole or halved cooked favas in a jar and pour brine to cover.  
- Spices (optional): 1 clove garlic, 1 tsp crushed red pepper.  
- Ferment: Seal with airlock, ferment 10–12 days at 18 °C.  
- Use: Bright bean salad, mezze, or quick-pickle garnish.

## Micro-batch Short Ferment: Quick Fava Bean Paste for One - Viability Assessment

Your proposed fava bean fermentation protocol is **fundamentally viable** but requires several critical adjustments to ensure food safety and successful fermentation. Here's a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and areas for improvement:

## Safety Assessment

**Primary Concerns:**

**Salt Levels Are Too Low**: Your 3% total salt content is on the borderline of fermentation safety standards. Research indicates that **fermented foods require 3-6% final salt concentration for safety**[1], with most lacto-fermentation experts recommending **minimum 2-4% salt by weight for vegetable ferments**[2][3]. Your 1g + 2g salt approach yields approximately 2.7% of the final mash weight, which is marginal for safety.

**pH Development Risk**: Fava beans naturally have a pH around 6.6[4], and achieving the critical pH below 4.6 required to prevent *Clostridium botulinum* growth[5][6] may be challenging with your current salt levels. Studies on fava bean fermentation show pH reduction to 5.05-5.54 after 44 hours with lactic acid bacteria[4], which may not be sufficient for complete safety.

**Temperature Control**: Your 18-22°C fermentation temperature is appropriate for lacto-fermentation[7][2], though many successful bean fermentations occur at slightly higher temperatures (25-30°C)[8][9].

## Technical Viability Issues

**Fermentation Starter**: Your protocol lacks a reliable starter culture. While environmental lactic acid bacteria can work, **inoculation with commercial LAB starter or vegetable starter culture significantly improves safety and consistency**[5][3], especially at lower salt concentrations.

**Vessel Safety**: Unglazed terracotta can be food-safe if properly fired above 1900°F (1038°C)[10], but most consumer terracotta isn't fired to these temperatures. **Unglazed ceramic can harbor bacteria in its porous structure**[11][12], making it less ideal for fermentation. If using terracotta, ensure it's **lead-free, food-grade, and properly fired**[13].

**Moisture Management**: Fava beans are less water-dense than traditional fermentation vegetables like cabbage. Your 20ml reserved cooking liquid may be insufficient to maintain proper brine coverage throughout fermentation.

## Recommended Improvements

**Increase Salt Content**: Raise total salt to **4-5% of final mash weight** (approximately 4-5g salt for 100g cooked beans)[2][3]. This provides better safety margin and improves texture retention.

**Add Starter Culture**: Include **1-2% vegetable starter culture or whey from previous ferment**[3] to ensure rapid acidification and competitive exclusion of pathogens.

**Improve Vessel Choice**: Consider using **food-grade glass jars with loose lids or proper fermentation crocks**[5][11] rather than unglazed terracotta. If using terracotta, verify it's food-safe ceramic fired to appropriate temperatures.

**Monitor pH**: Test pH at day 3, 7, and 10. **Fermentation should reach pH 4.6 or below by day 7** for safety[5][6].

**Extend Initial Fermentation**: Given fava beans' lower natural LAB population, consider **5-7 days active fermentation at 22-25°C** before reducing to storage temperature.

## Modified Protocol Recommendation

- Increase salt to 4-5g total (4-5% of cooked mash weight)
- Add 2-3ml vegetable starter culture or previous ferment liquid
- Use glass jar with loose lid instead of terracotta
- Maintain 22-25°C for first 5-7 days
- Test pH - should reach ≤4.6 by day 7
- Reduce temperature to 18°C for remaining fermentation period

## Alternative Approach

Your "lacto-pickled fava variation" with 5% brine is actually **safer and more predictable** than the paste method. The **5% salt brine provides better pathogen control**[2][14] and maintains proper anaerobic conditions more reliably.

The protocol shows good understanding of fermentation principles but needs these safety adjustments to be truly viable for consistent, safe results. With modifications, this could become an excellent micro-batch fermentation system for single-person households.
