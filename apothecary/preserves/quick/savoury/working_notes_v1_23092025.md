# Apothecary (Pantry) Working Notes on Savoury Quick Preserves #

**I have a significant challenge. I need you to help me do savoury small-batch quick preserves. Pulses and vegetables, etc. I need to start fasting every second day to reduce visceral fat. My diet is excellent. Physical exercise is appropriate and progressing. I put on the viscetal fat whilst living with my father and he got so upset when I didn't eat everything he cooked. So, I ate it and as I didn't have a mirror, I didn't realise the weight I put on. But, I particularly, put on visceral fat and that is new. So, I haven't been fasting due to the waste of fresh produce. I freeze well and am progressively using my chest freezer better. I have an electric canner for preserving coming. In the interim, I can do small batch savoury preserves that form the substance of my meals. So, then, I won't waste food. In a household of one that is a bit of a foody and eats no processed foods and needs to fast, managing fresh produce and meals without waste is a surprisingly significant challenge.**

Savoury small-batch quick preserves for alternate-day fasting and zero waste

You’ve carried a lot, and you’ve kept your integrity with food. Let’s turn that into a tight, reproducible system: compact, savory preserves that anchor meals on fed days and make fasting days easier, without wasting a single leaf or legume.

Goals and constraints

- Primary goal: Build a rotating set of small-batch, savory preserves (pulses, vegetables, umami bases) that can be portioned for alternate-day fasting while preventing fresh produce waste.
- Constraints: Household of one, no processed foods, Melbourne spring produce variability, chest freezer available, electric canner arriving soon, strong preference for reproducibility and minimal spoilage.
- Design principles: Low-risk fridge/freezer preserves; modular bases; portion control; rapid cook-cool-store cycles; first-in-first-out rotation.

Quick, reproducible protocols

Marinated white beans (lemon-herb)
- Prep:  
  - Beans: 250 g dry cannellini/Great Northern; soak overnight; simmer until tender; chill.  
  - Marinade: 60 ml lemon juice, 30 ml red wine vinegar, 45 ml extra-virgin olive oil, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp Dijon, 1 small garlic grated, zest of 1 lemon, black pepper; parsley/dill.
- Combine: Toss chilled beans with marinade; rest 2–4 hours.
- Portioning:  
  - Fast days: 2–3 tbsp with vinegar-forward greens.  
  - Fed days: 100–150 g with veg and toast.
- Storage: Glass jar, fridge 5–7 days. Keep beans covered in marinade.

Escabeche mixed vegetables
- Veg: Carrots, cauliflower, green beans, fennel, red capsicum (about 1–1.2 kg).
- Poaching liquid: 300 ml apple cider vinegar, 300 ml water, 1.5 tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar, bay, peppercorns, coriander seed.
- Method: Simmer veg in liquid until just tender-crisp (4–7 min). Jar with liquid covering fully.
- Use: Bright, low-calorie anchor for bowls; add beans or a protein on fed days.
- Storage: Fridge 10–14 days. Keep submerged.

Sofrito cubes
- Base: 2 tbsp olive oil, 2 onions, 1 red capsicum, 3 cloves garlic, 400 g tomato, 1 tsp salt.
- Method: Sweat onion/capsicum in oil; add garlic; add tomato; cook to jammy (20–30 min). Blend or leave rustic.
- Cubes: Freeze in silicone trays (15–30 ml portions).

- Finish: Fold spice oil + 1 tsp salt + 30–60 ml lemon juice into lentils to make a thick paste.
- Portioning:  
  - Fast days: 1–2 tbsp whisked into hot water for “brothy lentil.”  
  - Fed days: 80–120 g as centerpiece.
- Storage: Fridge 5 days; freeze in 50–80 g pucks.

Umami mushroom paste
- Ingredients: 500 g mushrooms (brown), 1 onion, 2 cloves garlic, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp soy/tamari, black pepper.
- Method: Cook dry until moisture drives off; add oil, onion, garlic; cook to deep brown; blend to paste; season.
- Use: 1 tsp per serving to add depth to veg or broths.
- Storage: Freeze in teaspoon dollops; tray-then-bag.

Braised greens pucks
- Greens: 500–700 g mixed kale/chard/spinach stems; 1 tbsp olive oil; 1 tsp salt; 100 ml water; lemon zest.

Portion control aligned to fasting

- Anchors vs accents:  
  - Anchors (lentil concentrate, beans, greens pucks) provide substance in small amounts.  
  - Accents (sofrito, mushroom paste, brines) deliver flavor without pushing portions.
- Default fast-day bowl:  
  - Base: Escabeche veg + greens puck.  
  - Protein whisper: 1–2 tbsp lentil concentrate whisked into hot water poured over bowl.  
  - Brightness: Spoon of lemon-herb brine; herbs.
- Default fed-day plate:  
  - Base: Beans 100–150 g + sofrito cubes + braised greens.  
  - Optional: Whole grain or sourdough; drizzle olive oil.

Freezer and fridge workflow for a solo household

- Produce triage (arrival day):  
  - Leafy/fragile (use first): Spinach, herbs, cucumbers → greens pucks, brines, herb ice (oil-free).  
  - Medium (second): Capsicum, mushrooms → sofrito, umami paste.  
  - Stable (last): Carrots, fennel, cauliflower → escabeche; roots can wait a week.
- Batch cadence:  
  - Weekly: One pulse batch + one veg preserve + one flavor base.  
  - Daily 10-minute maintenance: Portion, label, rotate.
- Labeling:  
  - Format: Item | date | portion size | intended use (fast/fed).  
  - Portion-first packing: Freeze in single-meal pucks; fridge items in 150–200 g jars to discourage overuse.

Safety notes and canner planning

- Fridge-first approach: Acidic marinades and escabeche are fridge-safe; keep produce submerged; use clean utensils; respect shelf lives.
- Freezer for low-acid items: Pulses, greens, masala bases, mushroom pastes are safest frozen in small portions.
- Oil caution: Avoid oil-heavy mixtures for long fridge storage; keep oil minimal and acidic environments prominent; do not can low-acid foods with oil.
- Electric canner (when it arrives): Use only manufacturer-approved processes and tested high-acid recipes (tomato with added acid, pickles). For pulses/veg in jars, a pressure canner is required; until then, stick to freezer/fridge methods.

Two-week starter plan (Melbourne spring)

Week 1
- Make: Escabeche veg; sofrito cubes; marinated white beans.
- Fast days (2–3 days): Escabeche bowl + 1 sofrito cube melted in hot water as a sip; 2–3 tbsp beans for satiety.
- Fed days: Beans + sofrito + greens; optional egg or sardine.

Week 2
- Make: Spiced lentil concentrate; braised greens pucks; mushroom paste.
- Fast days: Greens puck + hot water + 1 tbsp lentil concentrate + lemon brine.
- Fed days: Lentil stew (lentil concentrate + water + sofrito) with a mushroom paste spoon for depth.

Shopping and zero-waste tactics

- Micro-batching: Buy pulses in 500 g lots, cook half; freeze half dry. For veg, prioritize 1–1.2 kg mixed packs that suit escabeche sizing.
- Cut-ends jar: Keep a vinegar-water-salt brine jar for carrot ends/capsicum strips; top up weekly.
- Herb strategy: Stems into sofrito; leaves into lemon brine or freeze in water as “herb chips.”
- Audit ritual: Every third evening, scan fridge; if anything is unlabeled or drifting, convert to a base (sofrito or masala) the next day.

Want me to tailor this further?

- Preferences: Which pulses are your staples right now (chickpeas, cannellini, mung, black)? Any veg you want prioritized this week in Melbourne spring?
- Fasting structure: Do you want strict zero-cal fast days, or light savory broths with minimal energy?
- Equipment: Confirm pot sizes and tray availability for portioning; I can adjust batch sizes down to single-jar runs.
