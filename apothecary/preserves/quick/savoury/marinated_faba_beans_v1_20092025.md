# Marinated Faba Beans with Rosemary and Garlic #

---

### Equipment
- Sauce pan
- 24 oz mason jar

---

### Ingredients
- 1 cup dried faba beans (broadbeans)
- 2-2.5 cups filtered water
- 3 cloves garlic, smashed
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 0.5 tsp sea salt
- 1 cup vinegar

---

### Instructions

1. **Rinse the fava beans.** Add them to a medium-sized sauce pan. Add water to cover them (~4-5 cups). Turn heat on high and bring the pot to a boil.

2. Once it has reached a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid, and cook for 35-45 minutes. Check the beans at 30 minutes. If they are breaking apart, they are done. Overcooking the beans will make them mushy and lose their shape.

3. Drain the water from the cooked beans and rinse them to remove any particles from cooking.

4. Add the beans to a mason jar. Add the smashed garlic, rosemary, and salt.

5. Pour the vinegar in to cover the beans by about Â½ inch. This is about 1-2 cups of vinegar.

6. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and store in the fridge.

7. Marinate the fava beans for 1-3 days in the fridge (the longer they go, the stronger the flavor!).

### Notes
- The marinated faba beans may be stored in the fridge for up to 1 week after marinating.
