# Dried Sour Plums #


I want dried sour plums for a Persian stew. I want to get them for a good price. They are only dried plums, they should not be expensive. But when I looked, they were exhorbitant?

## How to Source Dried Sour Plums for Persian Stew at a Fair Price

### What Are Dried Sour Plums?

Dried sour plums—often called **aloo bukhara** or **aloocheh**—are a traditional ingredient in Persian cuisine, especially for stews (khoresh). They are simply plums that have been dried, sometimes salted or pitted, prized for their tartness and deep flavor.

### Why Do Dried Sour Plums Sometimes Cost So Much?

Despite being a humble ingredient, prices can rise due to:
- **Import status** (many are sourced from Iran or China)
- **Small packaging sizes**
- **Specialty store mark-ups** (ethnic and gourmet shops)
- **Branding or “Persian” labeling**, which can command a premium

Yet, the base cost should be modest—comparable to other dried fruits.

| **Say Weee! (Online Asian market)**   | Often below retail      | —            | On-demand, competitive pricing          | [6]            |
| **ShopIPersia (Iran, ships abroad)**  | Not listed              | 2.5kg bulk   | Bulk dried red plums (Aloo Jangali)     | [7]            |

### Tips to Avoid Overpaying

- **Buy bulk (500g+), avoid small “gourmet” packs:** Larger quantities are vastly cheaper per gram.
- **Shop at Asian, Persian, or Mediterranean grocers:** Prices are usually better than mainstream supermarkets or boutique delis.
- **Look for Chinese or Iranian product lines:** These typically reflect raw material costs, not boutique mark-up.
- **Online Asian groceries** like Weee! or Davely’s may provide cheaper delivery than importers or Persian specialty shops[6][10].
- **Avoid overpaying for branded/packaged “Persian” variants**—true “aloocheh” or “aloo bukhara” from a bulk supplier is essentially the same.
- **Consider bulk import if cooking often:** On Alibaba or similar, bulk runs as low as ~$5–7/kg, but shipping and minimum purchase apply[9][8].

### Final Guidance

**Your cheapest and best sources:**
- Brick-and-mortar Asian or Persian groceries in Melbourne (e.g., in Brunswick, Coburg, or South Melbourne) typically offer fair prices.
- Online, buy 200g+ packs for AUD $2–$8 (avoid tiny “snack” portions)[5][2][1].
- For large families or restaurant-scale, consider a bulk purchase from suppliers via Alibaba.

If you ever find prices above about $10–12 per 250g locally, consider another store—these are indeed basic dried fruit, and in bulk should be no more than $5–$7 per 100g retail, or as low as $2–$3/100g from the cheapest sources[9][8][5][2].

**In short**: Shop at mainstream Asian, Iranian, or Mediterranean grocery stores in your area, or buy bulk online from platforms that aggregate ethnic foods. You do not need to pay premium "Persian gourmet" prices for what is, in essence, a wonderfully ordinary dried fruit[2][5][1].

Re: Persian Stew. Does the pit add flavour and nutrients? Are salted problematic for Persian stews? Are particular plum varietals favoured? If so, why? Are Fresh plums ever used as well?

## Dried Sour Plums in Persian Stew: FAQ & Culinary Insights

### Does the Pit Add Flavour or Nutrients?

- **Flavour:** Yes; many Persian cooks and culinary experts agree that the **pit (stone)** of dried sour plums imparts extra depth and an almond-like nuance to stews. This is due to compounds in the stone’s kernel, similar in aromatic profile to bitter almond and cherry stones. The whole-plum (unpitted) version is traditionally prized for a richer, more complex flavor as the stew simmers.
- **Nutrients:** While the pit itself is not eaten (and contains amygdalin, which should not be consumed in quantity), slow cooking with the stone can leach trace minerals and subtle aromatic oils into the dish. The nutritional impact is minor, but the flavor benefit is widely recognized.

### Are Salted Dried Plums Problematic in Persian Stew?

- **Salt Content:** Salted dried plums can challenge the delicate seasoning balance of Persian stews (*khoresh*), which often emphasize a harmonious, tangy-sweet-sour profile.
- **Usability:** Use unsalted dried sour plums when possible. If only salted versions are available:
  - **Rinse and soak** them in water, then discard soaking water before use.
  - Adjust salt elsewhere in your recipe to avoid an over-salted stew.
- **Traditional Practice:** Most Persian recipes call for unsalted “aloocheh” or “aloo bukhara” to maintain authentic seasoning.

### Are Particular Plum Varietals Favoured?

Yes, certain varietals are preferred in Persian cuisine because of their flavor, tartness, and texture:

| Persian Name    | English/Common Name | Notes and Use in Stew          | Why Favoured                  |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Aloo bukhara**| Golden European plum (*Prunus domestica*) | Large, yellow/gold-fleshed, slightly sweet-sour | Holds shape, subtle tartness, widespread in Iran |
| **Aloocheh**    | Local wild sour plum (*Prunus divaricata*, *Prunus domestica insititia*) | Small, very tart, dark-skinned | Potent sourness, deeply traditional flavor |
| **Gojeh sabz**  | Unripe greengage (*Prunus domestica subsp. italica*) | Sometimes used fresh or dried for sharper sourness | Crisp acidity, spring seasonal specialty |

- Favoured because they give integrity (hold their form, don’t disintegrate), a desirable tangy-sweet flavor, and a subtle background perfume that suits khoresh like *khoresh-e aloo*, *khoresh-e fesenjan*, or *khoresh-e gheysi*.

### Are Fresh Plums Ever Used?

- **Occasional Usage:** While dried plums are classic and provide depth (from fermentation and dehydration concentrating flavor), some Persian dishes will use **fresh sour plums**, especially in early summer, for sharper, greener acidity.
- **Gojeh sabz:** Fresh, unripe green plums (*gojeh sabz*) are sometimes stewed whole in early spring and summer stews for their crispness and intense tartness.
- **Modern Adaptation:** In the absence of dried, fresh plums (particularly tart, firm-fleshed European types) can be substituted, though the stew may lack the complexity provided by dried and semi-dried fruit.

### Summary Recommendations

- For most authentic stews: choose **unpitted, unsalted dried sour plums** (aloocheh, aloo bukhara).
- If using salted: soak and rinse well, then adjust overall salt.
- Seek traditional Iranian, wild, or European golden/yellow varieties for “true” Persian flavor.
- Fresh plums can be substituted or featured in seasonal stews but will yield a subtly different result.
