## Extra Virgin Olive Oil ##

With a freshly pressed, cold-extracted extra virgin olive oil, pressed from fresh olives, decanted into airtight small bottles and stored under typical Temperate Zone conditions, you may generally expect it to stay free from perceptible rancidity for circa **12 to 18 months**, provided you minimize exposure to heat, light and air[2][3].

- **Rancidity occurs mainly via oxidative processes**, accelerated by oxygen, light, warmth and time[1][2][3].
- **Extra virgin olive oil with recent press/high polyphenol content** is more resistant, but even so, quality starts to decline after about a year, especially if exposed to ambient conditions[2].
- Temperate zone climate, whilst relatively mild, may experience Summer spikes; keeping oil in a cool, dark cupboard, store or pantry, is essential. Decanting into *airtight, opaque* bottles further prolongs shelf life by minimizing oxygen and light exposure[2][3].
- Signs of rancidity include loss of fruitiness and the development of “paint-like” or acrid aromas and flavours. Oils with a peroxide value (PV) under 12 are considered very fresh; values over 17 typically correlate with rancidity (usually after >2 years at typical storage conditions)[1][2].

**Practical ballpark**:  
- If stored well (airtight, dark, cool, filled to the top), expect 12–18 months before noticeable rancidity.
- If exposed to heat, air, or light, rancidity may develop in as little as 6–9 months.

*Tip*: Decant only as needed into a working bottle from your 3L tin, keeping the remainder as undisturbed as possible, and avoid clear or translucent containers for storage[3].

If you follow these best practices in a Temperate Zone, you should have ample time to use a 3L tin before quality deteriorates significantly.

So, the 3L tin has re-useable seals and is airtight, so opening doesn't really compromise it. So, it is unnecessary to decant all of it immediately? I have a circa 500ml little air-tight glass bottle, that has mechanisms to both pour and spray, which is my working source. So, just decanting in that is optimal?

If your 3L tin is truly airtight and resealable, there is no need to decant all the oil immediately. Simply decanting what you need into a smaller airtight bottle (like your 500ml glass pour/spray bottle) is optimal: this way, the bulk of the oil remains well protected from air and light[1][2][5][6].

- Exposure to oxygen is a key factor in rancidity; keeping most of your oil sealed in its tin minimizes that risk[5][6].
- Only decanting into your working 500ml bottle as needed is efficient and helps preserve freshness of the remaining oil[1][6][8].
- Ensure your 500ml bottle is kept in a cool, dark place, since heat and light also accelerate spoilage[1][4][6].

Decanting your entire tin immediately into many smaller containers is unnecessary if the tin maintains a proper seal after each use. Your planned method (one small, airtight working bottle refilled when needed) is both convenient and optimal for shelf life with Melbourne’s typical conditions[1][2][4][6].

Is it sunlight, flourescent and/or incandescent light that hastens spoilage in extra virgin olive oil?

All forms of light—sunlight, fluorescent, and incandescent—can hasten the spoilage of extra virgin olive oil, but **sunlight (especially direct sunlight)** is the most damaging, as it contains high-intensity visible and ultraviolet (UV) rays that accelerate oxidation and rancidity more rapidly than artificial light sources[2][8].

- **Sunlight**: The strongest risk, due to both UV and visible light, rapidly increases oxidation in olive oil[2][8].
- **Fluorescent and incandescent light**: Both can also accelerate spoilage if the oil is exposed over time, but their oxidizing effect is generally less intense than that of direct sunlight. However, artificial light in kitchens or stores can still degrade oil quality, especially over months[2][3].
- **Practical guidance**: Any exposure to light (natural or artificial) hastens loss of aroma, antioxidants and flavour. Glass bottles—even dark ones—should be stored away from all light sources[2].

For optimal freshness, store olive oil in a dark, cool place away from all light—especially sunlight—to substantially delay rancidity[2][8].
